# Te Ara Turi: The NZ DHH Developmental Framework
**Alignment:** New Zealand Curriculum (NZC) Phases 1–5
**Context:** Aotearoa New Zealand (Bi-cultural & Bi-lingual)

This framework recognizes that DHH learners do not just need "access" to the standard curriculum; they require a distinct developmental pathway that prioritizes **Visual Fluency**, **Identity Formation**, and **Mana Motuhake** (Self-Determination).

---

## Phase 1: The Visual & Language Foundation
**NZC Alignment:** Years 1–3 (Ages ~5–8)
**Focus:** *Whakawhanaungatanga & Visual Anchoring*

| Key Focus | Rationale (Logic & Justification) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Language Fluency First"**<br>Prioritizing the acquisition of a secure First Language (L1)—whether NZSL or Spoken—above academic content delivery. | **Neuro-Developmental Urgency:** The brain’s plasticity for language acquisition peaks in these years. If a DHH child attempts to learn *content* without first securing *language*, they risk cognitive delays. The logic here is "Access before Academics." |
| **"The Visual Ecosystem"**<br>Establishing a learning environment where 100% of information is accessible to the eye, reducing reliance on auditory cues. | **Cognitive Load Theory:** A DHH child in a standard environment spends significant energy just trying to *perceive* the lesson. By making the environment visually explicit (Deaf Space), we free up cognitive bandwidth for actual learning and connection. |

**Critical Action:** **The "Eyes-Up" Culture.** Instilling the habit that communication requires visual connection (eye contact). This is the "literacy of attention" required for all future learning.

## Phase 2: The Awakening of Identity
**NZC Alignment:** Years 4–6 (Ages ~8–11)
**Focus:** *Ko Wai Au? (Who Am I?) & Connection*

| Key Focus | Rationale (Logic & Justification) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Deafhood & Narrative"**<br>Moving from "having a hearing loss" (medical view) to "being DHH" (cultural/identity view). | **Psychosocial Prevention:** This is the age where children begin social comparison. Without intervention, DHH students often conclude they are "broken" hearing people. We counter this logic by introducing "Deaf Gain"—showing the value and history of the Deaf community to build resilience. |
| **"The Academic Pivot"**<br>Bridging the gap between "social language" (playground chat) and "academic language" (abstract concepts). | **The "Fourth Grade Slump":** Global data shows DHH students often plateau here as texts move from pictures to abstract words. The rationale is to use explicit visual scaffolding (diagrams, drama, visual coding) to ensure deep conceptual understanding, not just surface decoding. |

**Critical Action:** **Mirrors & Windows.** The curriculum must provide "mirrors" where they see successful Deaf adults, and "windows" into the wider world. Introduction of NZSL/Deaf Studies as a core subject.

## Phase 3: The Strategic Bridge
**NZC Alignment:** Years 7–8 (Ages ~11–13)
**Focus:** *Tino Rangatiratanga (Self-Management) of Access*

| Key Focus | Rationale (Logic & Justification) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Access Management"**<br>Shifting the responsibility of communication access from the teacher to the student. | **Preparation for Complexity:** Secondary school environments are volatile and less protected. Students must learn the meta-cognitive skills to manage interpreters, troubleshoot hearing technology, and request environmental changes *before* they hit the high-stakes environment of Year 9. |
| **"Expressive Confidence"**<br>Using arts and technology to demonstrate knowledge without language barriers. | **Equity of Expression:** DHH students often have intelligence that outpaces their English literacy output. We prioritize modes of assessment (visual presentations, NZSL logging, digital creation) that allow them to prove their intellect without being penalized for linear English delays. |

**Critical Action:** **The "Driver’s Seat" Transition.** Students begin co-facilitating their own IEP (Individual Education Plan) meetings, articulating their own learning preferences and needs.

---

## Phases 4 & 5: Pathways to Mana Motuhake
**NZC Alignment:** Years 9–13 (Ages ~14–18+)
**Focus:** *Advocacy, Ethics & Bi-Cultural Navigation*

| Key Focus | Rationale (Logic & Justification) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Systemic Navigation"**<br>Developing the critical thinking skills to analyze and navigate the "hearing world" and its institutions. | **Real-World Resilience:** The "protection" of school ends soon. The logic is to equip students with the ethical and legal understanding of their rights (e.g., NZ Human Rights Act, UNCRPD) so they can advocate for equity in employment and tertiary settings. |
| **"Bicultural Competence"**<br>Navigating the dual worlds of the Deaf community and the Hearing society (and for Māori DHH, Te Ao Māori). | **Code-Switching Mastery:** Success for a DHH adult often depends on "code-switching"—changing communication styles to fit the audience. We explicitly teach the social rules of the hearing world as a "second culture" to be mastered, not a superior culture to submit to. |

**Critical Action:** **Tuakana/Teina (Mentorship).** Senior students are formally trained to mentor Phase 1 & 2 students, solidifying their own leadership skills and creating a sustainable cycle of role modelling.

## Critical Pillars of the Framework

### 1. The Tuakana Concept (Peer Authority)
In mainstream education, the teacher is the authority. In DHH education, **Shared Experience** is the authority.
* **Logic:** A hearing teacher can teach content, but cannot teach the "lived experience" of being Deaf.
* **Implementation:** Regular, structured interaction between Phase 4/5 students (Tuakana) and Phase 1/2 students (Teina) is a curriculum requirement, not an optional extra.

### 2. "Hand-First" Pedagogy (Experiential Anchoring)
DHH memory is strongly visual and kinesthetic.
* **Logic:** Teaching abstract vocabulary in isolation is low-yield for DHH brains.
* **Implementation:** We use an "Experience $\rightarrow$ Language $\rightarrow$ Literacy" sequence. We *do* the science experiment (Hand), then we *sign/discuss* it (Language), and only then do we *read/write* about it (Literacy). The physical memory anchors the text.

### 3. Visual Rhythm & Regulation
Replacing auditory regulation (bells, voice tone) with visual regulation.
* **Logic:** A chaotic visual environment creates "visual noise" that fatigues DHH students.
* **Implementation:** Use of consistent visual schedules, lighting cues for transitions, and clear sightlines (circular seating) to create a "low-friction" learning environment that supports nervous system regulation.
