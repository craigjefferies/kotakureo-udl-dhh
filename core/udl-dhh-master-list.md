# Universal Design for DHH Learners in Aotearoa: High-Leverage Practices

## Phase 1: Teacher-Led Implementation (Categorized by Domain)

### Domain A: The Bi-Literacy Bridge (NZSL ↔ English)
*Focus: Explicitly linking NZSL, visual concepts, and English orthography. Uses orthographic mapping and language chaining to build biliteracy.*

| High-Leverage Practice & Teacher Definition | Teaching Ideas for DHH Students (Good Practice Examples) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Visual Grammar Mechanics**<br>*Visually highlight high-frequency, low-audibility sounds (like 's', 'ed', 't') that DHH students cannot access via listening.* | 1. **The "Plural S" Spotter:** DHH students often miss plural markers. Circle every 's' at the end of words in **red** on the whiteboard. Have students physically "snake" their hand or hold up an 'S' card whenever they see/sign a plural. |
| | 2. **Morphology Traffic Lights:** Use consistent colours: **Green** for Prefixes (Start), **Black** for Roots, and **Red** for Suffixes (End). When writing "Unkindly", write "Un" (Green), "kind" (Black), "ly" (Red) to visually prove the structure. |
| | 3. **Shape Coding (Patterning):** Assign shapes to parts of speech to show sentence patterns (e.g., **Blue Triangles** = Articles, **Red Circles** = Verbs). Have students physically arrange these cut-out shapes to build sentence structures before writing words inside them. |
| **Language Chaining**<br>*Explicitly connecting a sign, the written word, and the concept in a specific sequence to build a literacy bridge.* | 1. **The Chain Routine:** Explicitly link a concept using the sequence: **Sign/Image $\to$ Finger-spell/Write $\to$ Sign/Image.** (e.g., Sign "Volcano," point to the written word "Volcano," Sign "Volcano" again). This "sandwiches" the text in meaning. |
| | 2. **Fingerspelling Focus:** When a key term appears, **fingerspell it** (or write it in the air) immediately after signing/saying it. This forces attention to the *internal structure* (spelling) of the word, not just the whole-word shape. |
| | 3. **Text Anchoring:** When reading aloud or signing a story, **keep a finger physically placed** on the specific word or sentence on the Smartboard/Book while explaining it. Do not remove the finger until the explanation is done. |
| **Language Experience Approach (LEA)**<br>*Creating text based on a shared class experience to ensure students possess the background knowledge required to understand the reading.* | 1. **"Do, Discuss, Draft":** (1) **Do:** Perform a class activity (e.g., a science experiment). (2) **Discuss:** Sign about what happened. (3) **Draft:** Teacher writes the students' *exact signed sentences* on the board in English. (4) **Read:** Class reads the co-created text together. |
| **Critical content is taught**<br>*Identify and explicitly teach the core vocabulary and concepts before the lesson begins to reduce cognitive load.* | 1. **Pre-Teach Vocabulary:** Collaborate with the support unit to **pre-teach critical vocabulary** using **semantic feature analysis** (charts comparing features of related words) 24 hours before the content is introduced to the class. |
| | 2. **Visual Analogies:** Use **high-quality, concrete visual analogies** to explain abstract concepts (e.g., comparing the function of a cell membrane to a screen door). Write the analogy on the board and keep the image visible. |
| | 3. **Word Map Anchor:** Create a **large, permanent word map** for the core concept (e.g., The Water Cycle) that links the concept to synonyms, NZSL signs, visual representations, and a key sentence. |
| **Knowledge extension**<br>*Visually link new learning to prior knowledge using graphic organizers to help students organize information.* | 1. **Bridge Map Anchor:** Use a simple **"Bridge Map" graphic organizer** on the board to visually link prior knowledge to the new concept (e.g., *Metaphor* is to *Figurative Language* AS *Addition* is to *Math Operations*). |
| | 2. **Concept Labeling:** Write the new concept (e.g., *Photosynthesis*) and then write a **synonym or "tag"** from a previous unit below it (e.g., *—> Plant Energy Creation*), using a bright arrow to show the connection. |
| | 3. **Review Card Link:** When reviewing prior knowledge, hold up a **review card** from the old unit. Before introducing the new topic, ask the student to **sign or write one way** the old concept connects to the new topic. |

### Domain B: Sensory & Physical Access (The Whare)
*Focus: The physical learning environment (acoustics, lighting, seating) and managing cognitive/sensory fatigue. Blocks the "Sensory" Swiss Cheese holes.*

| High-Leverage Practice & Teacher Definition | Teaching Ideas for DHH Students (Good Practice Examples) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Managing Listening Fatigue**<br>*Proactively schedule quiet breaks and reduce background noise to prevent the exhaustion caused by constant auditory processing.* | 1. **"Eyes/Ears Off" Moments:** Plan specific 2-minute blocks where **no visual or auditory attention is required**. (e.g., "For 2 minutes, put your head down or close your eyes while you think about [Topic].") This resets the sensory processing center. |
| | 2. **Acoustic Triage:** Reduce competitive noise. Put **tennis balls on chair legs**, turn off the projector fan when not in use, and shut the door during instruction to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio for hearing aid/implant users. |
| | 3. **Captioning as Default:** Turn on **Closed Captions (CC)** for *every* video, regardless of length. This reduces the cognitive load of trying to decipher audio, allowing the brain to focus on content. |
| **Attention cues**<br>*Use established visual signals to ensure the student is looking at the source of information before instruction begins.* | 1. **Light Cue System:** Establish a small, **flashing light or desk lamp** next to the teacher or screen that is activated *before* the teacher speaks/signs. The student is trained to immediately stop work and look at the light source. |
| | 2. **Shoulder Tap Signal:** Use a **clear, non-alarming physical signal** like a gentle tap on the desk or shoulder for close-proximity work. Wait until the student has made eye contact before beginning communication. |
| | 3. **The "Look-Back" Rule:** Teach all students a classroom rule that when the teacher signals for attention, they must look at the teacher, then **look at the DHH student(s)** to ensure the visual cue is being processed before any class-wide instruction begins. |
| **Organised and focused**<br>*Maintain a consistent, visually labeled environment so students spend energy on learning, not searching for materials.* | 1. **Consistent Storage Location:** Use **labels, photos, and clear containers** for all materials. For instance, the math manipulatives are *always* in the blue bin with a photo of the blocks on the lid. |
| | 2. **Task Checklist Handout:** Provide a **printed checklist** for multi-part tasks or assignments. The student uses a highlighter to mark off each step upon completion, turning an auditory list into a concrete, manageable visual sequence. |
| | 3. **Colour-Coded Materials:** Systematically **colour-code notebooks, folders, and resources** for different subjects (e.g., Red for Writing, Blue for Science) to aid in quick location and organization. |
| **Monitoring**<br>*Plan specific times to check on the DHH student to catch misunderstandings early without relying on them to ask for help.* | 1. **Monitoring Rota:** Use a **visual classroom map** or checklist to ensure the DHH student is intentionally checked on at least **three specific times** during independent work. |
| | 2. **Traffic Light System:** Have students place a **green, yellow, or red card** on the corner of their desk to silently signal their status (Green=Fine, Yellow=Need help soon, Red=Stuck). This prioritizes the teacher's check-ins visually. |
| | 3. **Photo Evidence:** For task completion, encourage the student to **take a quick photo or drawing** of their finished product/step on a device to visually confirm they understood and completed the instruction. |

### Domain C: Multi-Modal Instruction (Dual Coding)
*Focus: Providing multiple access points to the same Mātauranga via Sign, Text, Image, and Routine.*

| High-Leverage Practice & Teacher Definition | Teaching Ideas for DHH Students (Good Practice Examples) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Separation of Modalities**<br>*Deliver information sequentially rather than simultaneously to prevent linguistic degradation and cognitive overload.* | 1. **"Show, Freeze, Tell":** Never speak/sign *while* showing a complex visual. Point to the image/text, **freeze your body** to let them look, then turn to the class to explain it. Keep the visual and the explanation sequential. |
| | 2. **The "Modality Switch":** Avoid "Simultaneous Communication" (SimCom). If you are signing, focus on clear NZSL. If you are speaking, focus on clear spoken English. Do not try to do both perfectly at once; one always suffers. |
| **Seek and Locate Time**<br>*Extend wait time to allow students to physically orient themselves to the speaker before communication begins.* | 1. **The "3-Second Scan":** After calling on a student, hold up a hand and wait **3 full seconds** before allowing them to answer. This gives the DHH student time to physically turn their body and visually locate the peer who is speaking. |
| | 2. **"Hands Down" Listen:** Require all students to put their hands down while someone else is talking. Visual "noise" from waving hands distracts the DHH student from finding the active speaker. |
| **Clear Communication**<br>*Ensure the student has a clear, unobstructed view of the face/hands and modify pacing to allow for processing time.* | 1. **Visual Vocabulary Cards:** When using a new key word, hold up a **large, printed vocabulary card** that includes the word, a simple definition, and a corresponding **NZSL sign or picture** before you say or sign the word. |
| | 2. **"Face the Board, Then Face the Class" Routine:** Always **write first** on the board, then **step away** from the board, turn, and face the class to explain/sign the content. Never talk while writing. |
| | 3. **Controlled Pacing:** Consciously **slow your rate of speech/signing** slightly, maintaining a natural rhythm, to maximize the student's ability to speechread or process signs without exaggeration. |
| **Chunks of information given**<br>*Break complex instructions into small, numbered segments with visual pauses to prevent working memory overload.* | 1. **Number Your Steps:** When giving a multi-step instruction, **display the steps numerically** on the board (1., 2., 3.) and pause after explaining each number, waiting for a visual acknowledgement before moving to the next. |
| | 2. **Visual Divider/Spacer:** Use a **coloured piece of paper, a line, or a sign** (e.g., a "PAUSE" sign) on the board to visually separate one chunk of information from the next, preventing cognitive overload. |
| | 3. **Check-in Between Chunks:** After delivering Chunk 2, ask the student to **sign, draw, or write the instruction for Chunk 1** before proceeding, ensuring the first piece of information was successfully retained. |
| **Learning intention is shared**<br>*Display the lesson goal visually and permanently so the student always knows exactly what they are learning and why.* | 1. **Visual Objective Board:** Use a dedicated board section for the daily learning intention and success criteria. Use a **colour-coded key** (e.g., Green for WALT, Blue for WILF) to provide a clear, static visual anchor. |
| | 2. **Concept-Specific Icon:** Pair the **key vocabulary/topic** with a permanent, visually distinct icon or image (e.g., a magnifying glass for "Analyse," a cloud for "Weather") that is used every time the concept is referenced across subjects. |
| | 3. **Interactive Review:** At the start of the lesson, point to the learning intention and have the student physically **move a small magnet or arrow** from the "To Do" column to the "Doing" column, establishing a clear visual contract for the work. |
| **Perky pace**<br>*Maintain a structured, energetic rhythm using visual timers and clear transitions to keep engagement high.* | 1. **Visible Agenda Flow:** Display the lesson agenda as a **series of boxes** on the board (e.g., Review → New Concept → Activity). **Physically check off or cover** each box as the class completes it to provide a visual marker of progress and structure. |
| | 2. **Chunking Timer:** Use a **visual countdown timer** (e.g., 5 minutes) for each instructional "chunk." When the timer hits zero, pause for a mandatory **"Comprehension Check"** before moving to the next segment. |
| | 3. **Structured Review Warm-ups:** Begin every lesson with a 2-minute, routine visual review of the previous day's **3 key facts** using flashcards or images, instantly setting a predictable and focused pace. |
| **Look around Walk around Talk around**<br>*Circulate the room to monitor non-verbal cues and provide discreet, immediate support where needed.* | 1. **Proximity Check-Ins:** When circulating, approach the DHH student and **pause for 3 seconds** before saying/signing anything. This gives the student time to transition from the task to the visual conversation cue. |
| | 2. **Written Re-instruction Cards:** Carry a small stack of note cards or a small tablet. If a student is confused, **write down the simplified, core instruction** (e.g., "Find 3 adjectives on page 5") rather than relying on a verbal-only restatement. |
| | 3. **Non-Verbal Cue Monitoring:** Focus scanning on specific non-verbal cues from the DHH student, such as **eye tracking, brow furrowing, or a lack of initiating the task**, and use these as triggers for a quiet, individualized check-in. |

### Domain D: Explicit Teaching & Scaffolding (The "How")
*Focus: Systematic instruction (I do - We do - You do) that makes the "hidden" thinking process visible.*

| High-Leverage Practice & Teacher Definition | Teaching Ideas for DHH Students (Good Practice Examples) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **I do we do you do**<br>*Move from teacher modeling to guided practice to independence, providing visual supports at every stage.* | 1. **Written Model Handout:** Provide a **written transcript or detailed, step-by-step handout** of the "I Do" model to supplement the live demonstration/signing. This allows the student to reference the language and syntax visually. |
| | 2. **Sentence Structure Strips:** During the "We Do" phase, use **magnetic word/phrase cards or paper strips** on a board to build the required complex sentence structure, allowing the student to physically manipulate the parts of speech. |
| | 3. **Explicit Vocabulary and Syntax Box:** As you model (I Do), dedicate a **specific box or bubble on the board** labeled "Academic Language" and list the target vocabulary and sentence starters to be used in the "You Do" phase. |
| **Examples $\ne$ Non-examples**<br>*Clarify concepts by explicitly showing what they are NOT, effectively defining the boundaries of the rule.* | 1. **T-Chart of Distinction:** Draw a **large, clear T-chart** labeled "Example" and "Non-Example" (or "Is" and "Is Not"). Place a visual and written explanation in the respective columns and explicitly sign/point to the features that make the distinction. |
| | 2. **Correction Mark Focus:** When correcting student work, use a **different-coloured pen** (e.g., green) to clearly circle the **specific part** that is a non-example (e.g., circling a run-on sentence when teaching simple sentences) and write the correction beside it. |
| | 3. **"Sort the Rules" Game:** Use flashcards with examples and non-examples, and have students **physically sort** them into two separate labeled piles, verbalizing/signing the rule for each pile as they go. |
| **Concept Relationship & Error Analysis**<br>*Ask students to identify relationships or fix errors to prove deep understanding rather than just recall.* | 1. **"The Missing Link" Map:** Present two concepts (e.g., "Sun" and "Plant") with a blank arrow between them. The student must **write or sign the verb/process** that connects them (e.g., "gives energy to"). This checks deep conceptual understanding, not just memory. |
| | 2. **"Spot the Error" Analysis:** Present a completed sentence, math problem, or diagram that contains **one deliberate error**. Ask the student to **circle the error and correct it**. This proves they understand the rules well enough to identify non-examples. |
| | 3. **Digital Poll/Quiz:** Use a simple digital response system (e.g., a quick multiple-choice quiz or poll) to gather **immediate, written data** from the student, providing a fast, non-verbal check for understanding. |
| **Critical Inquiry (HOTS)**<br>*Move beyond recall questions to Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) by demanding evidence for every claim.* | 1. **The "HOTS" Check:** Implement a classroom routine where students must answer **"How do you know?"** or **"Why?"** for every claim. They must reference specific evidence (e.g., *"I know he is sad because the text says 'tears rolled down'"*) before their answer is accepted. |

### Domain E: Mana Motuhake & Agency (Self-Regulation)
*Focus: Empowering ākonga to understand their hearing profile, notice communication breakdowns, and drive their own access solutions.*

| High-Leverage Practice & Teacher Definition | Teaching Ideas for DHH Students (Good Practice Examples) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Explicit Self-Advocacy**<br>*Teach and script specific phrases that allow the student to independently manage their own communication access.* | 1. **The "Repair" Cue Card:** Tape a card to the student's desk with 3 specific phrases: **"Please repeat," "Please rephrase,"** and **"I missed the last part."** Teach the student to point to these instead of just looking confused. |
| | 2. **Role-Play the Interruption:** Practice a scenario where the teacher intentionally mumbles or turns away. The student is rewarded for **stopping the lesson** to ask for clarity, normalizing the "interruption" as a positive learning tool. |
| | 3. **Equipment Independence:** The student must be responsible for the **FM System/Microphone hand-off**. They must physically hand the mic to the peer who is speaking, ensuring they own their access to sound. |
| **Simultaneous Response Cards**<br>*Use physical cards for whole-class answers to ensure every student participates and provide immediate assessment data.* | 1. **"Pinch Card" System:** Provide a card with answers (A, B, C, D) or options (True, False, Not Sure) written on the edges. Students **pinch the correct answer** and hold it against their chest. This prevents copying peers and demands a cognitive choice. |
| | 2. **Concept Discrimination:** Instead of asking "Do you get it?", hold up two concept cards (e.g., "Noun" vs "Verb") and read/sign a word. The student must **hold up the corresponding card**. This proves they can distinguish the concepts. |
| | 3. **Visual Confidence Scale:** Use a "Traffic Light" card (Red/Orange/Green). Ask: "Rate your ability to do this alone right now." This is more nuanced than Yes/No and gives the teacher immediate data on who needs scaffolding. |
| **Engagement Opportunity Inclusion**<br>*Structure class interactions (like wait time and partner work) so DHH students can participate on equal footing.* | 1. **Mini-Whiteboard Response:** Require all students to write or draw their answer on a mini-whiteboard and **hold it up** simultaneously. This provides a constant, low-stakes visual check on the DHH student’s understanding. |
| | 2. **Sequential Wait Time Practice:** Explicitly teach the DHH student and their peers the concept of **"Think Time" and "Sign Time."** Use a visual timer (e.g., sand timer or on-screen countdown) for 5-10 seconds after a question before accepting responses. |
| | 3. **Visible Partner Check:** When using a paired-share, require partners to **physically point** to the part of the text/diagram that supports their answer before they speak/sign, forcing a visual justification of the response. |
| **Overt responses**<br>*Require physical actions (pointing, writing, signing) to demonstrate understanding rather than relying on verbal assurances.* | 1. **"Show Me the Evidence" Pointing:** When discussing a text, require the student to **physically point** to the sentence, word, or illustration that supports their answer before they speak/sign the response. |
| | 2. **Structured Note-Taking:** Provide **guided notes or graphic organizers** with blanks or boxes for students to write key facts during a lecture. This forces a visual, written response throughout the lesson. |
| | 3. **NZSL Role Model/Use:** Ensure the teacher or a peer is a **fluent NZSL model** for students who use sign language. Use clear, conceptually accurate signs for academic terms and encourage the student to sign back their explanations. |
| **Feedback in a positive tone**<br>*Provide specific, visual feedback that highlights correct actions and gives clear, written steps for improvement.* | 1. **Written Goal Card:** Give all constructive feedback on a **small, designated "Next Goal" card** that the student can tape to their desk or workbook. This makes the goal permanent and visually accessible. |
| | 2. **Three:One Ratio:** Systematically aim for a **three-to-one ratio of positive, specific feedback** to corrective feedback. Ensure positive feedback is visually tied to the task (e.g., pointing to the paragraph and signing/saying "Great use of a compound sentence here!"). |
| | 3. **Feedback-First Correction:** When correcting an error, first acknowledge what was done correctly, then **write the correct solution** (e.g., "Good try, *this* is the correct symbol/sign," writing the correct letter shape). |
| **Student Self-Graphing**<br>*Students track their own data visually to see progress over time, serving as a powerful intrinsic motivator.* | 1. **The Fluency Bar Chart:** After a timed reading, vocabulary quiz, or math sprint, the student **colors in a bar chart** to show their score. They physically see the "bar" go up over the weeks, connecting effort to growth. |

### Domain F: Symbolic & Mathematical Structure (Concrete ↔ Abstract)
*Focus: Making abstract systems visible. Bridging concrete reality to abstract symbols in Maths, Science, and Digital Technology.*

| High-Leverage Practice & Teacher Definition | Teaching Ideas for DHH Students (Good Practice Examples) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Visualizing Place Value (Structure)**<br>*Use physical manipulatives to demonstrate the difference between numbers that look or sound similar (like 13 and 30).* | 1. **The "Teen" vs. "Ty" Visual Check:** DHH students often confuse *14* and *40*. Teach the rule visually: **Teens = 10 + Unit**. **Tys = Unit $\times$ 10**. Use **physical Base-10 blocks** to prove the difference (a pile of 14 vs 4 big stacks of 10) every time these numbers come up. |
| | 2. **Place Value "Houses":** Use a permanent visual structure (Houses) on the board for ones, tens, hundreds. When calculating, physically **move the digit** into the next "house" to demonstrate multiplying by 10/100, rather than just "adding a zero." |
| | 3. **Expanded Form Anchors:** Always write numbers in expanded form under the standard form (e.g., 345 $\to$ 300 + 40 + 5) to reinforce that the "3" is not just a digit, but a quantity of 300. |
| **Decoding Math Vocabulary (Knowledge)**<br>*Explicitly teach the specific mathematical meanings of words and symbols that differ from everyday language.* | 1. **The Math Dictionary Wall:** Create a specific section on the Word Wall for **Polysemous Words** (multiple meanings). Show the word "Table" with a picture of furniture (crossed out) and a picture of a data chart (circled). |
| | 2. **Symbol-to-Sign Translation:** Explicitly teach the translation of symbols to verbs. $\times$ isn't just "times"; it is **"groups of."** $\div$ isn't just "divide"; it is **"shared between."** Use these more descriptive phrases/signs to build conceptual understanding. |
| | 3. **The "Key Word" Trap:** *Avoid* teaching keywords like "more means plus". Instead, teach **Action Scripting**: Draw out the action of the story—are things coming together (Combine) or separating (Compare/Remove)? |
| **Visualizing Operations (Strategy)**<br>*Use visual models (like bar models or number lines) to represent mathematical relationships without relying on complex syntax.* | 1. **Bar Modeling (Singapore Math):** <br><br><br> Use **Bar Models** for *every* word problem. This visualizes the "Part-Part-Whole" relationship. It replaces the need to hold the linguistic sentence in working memory. |
| | 2. **Algorithm Checklists:** For multi-step strategies (like long division or multi-digit multiplication), provide a **vertical visual checklist** with icons (Divide $\to$ Multiply $\to$ Subtract $\to$ Bring Down). The student moves a paperclip down the list as they solve. |
| | 3. **Number Line "Jumps":** When teaching addition/subtraction strategies, avoid just mental math. Require the student to **draw the "jumps"** on an open number line (e.g., jumping to the nearest 10 first). This visualizes their mental strategy. |

### Domain G: Critical Thinking & Metalinguistics (Deep Dive)
*Focus: Explicitly teaching the "inner voice" and higher-order thinking (Infer, Compare, Justify) that leads to deep understanding.*

| High-Leverage Practice & Teacher Definition | Teaching Ideas for DHH Students (Good Practice Examples) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Explicit Code Switching (BICS vs CALP)**<br>*Visually distinguish between "Social Chat" (BICS) and "Academic Language" (CALP) to help students shift cognitive gears.* | 1. **The "Academic Hat":** Use a physical prop (like a specific hat, scarf, or sign on the board) that signals: *"We are now in Deep Learning Mode."* When this signal is up, students must use full sentences and academic vocabulary, not casual signing/speech. |
| | 2. **Register Mapping:** When a student gives a "social" answer (e.g., "It got bigger"), write it on one side of the board (Social). Ask the class to "translate" it to the **Academic side** (e.g., "The object expanded in volume"). |
| **Visual Morphology (The "Anti-Phonics")**<br>*Shift reading instruction from "Sound it out" (Auditory) to "Analyse the Parts" (Visual) using prefixes, roots, and suffixes.* | 1. **Word Sums Matrix:** Instead of rhyming, teach **Word Sums**. Show that *Sign + al = Signal* and *Sign + ature = Signature*. This teaches the student to look for the **meaning unit** (Sign) rather than getting confused because the "g" is silent in one word and pronounced in the other. |
| | 2. **Prefix/Suffix Operations:** Teach affixes as "math rules" for language. Create a visual equation: **Un- (Not) + Happy (Feeling) = Not Happy.** This gives the student a logical, visual way to decode new vocabulary without needing to "hear" the word first. |
| | 3. **The "Root" Tree:** Create a permanent visual tree for common roots (e.g., "Spect" = Look). Add leaves for words like *Inspect, Spectator, Spectacles*. When a student is stuck on a big word, point to the "Root" rather than telling them to "sound it out." |
| **Metacognitive "Think-Alouds"**<br>*The teacher dramatically narrates their own internal struggle and problem-solving process to make the "inner voice" visible.* | 1. **Modeling the "Stuck" Moment:** Purposefully "forget" a word or get confused during a lesson. **Sign/Say:** "Wait, I am stuck. My brain is confused. What should I do? I will look at the Word Wall." This explicitly teaches the student *how* to use the resources you built in Phase 1. |
| | 2. **The "Why" Narrative:** When performing a task (like writing on the board), narrate the *hidden decision*. "I am writing this in Red because it is a warning." "I am erasing this part because it was messy." This gives context to actions that otherwise look arbitrary to DHH students. |
| | 3. **Theory of Mind Anchors:** DHH students often struggle to understand that others have different thoughts/knowledge (Theory of Mind). When reading a story, use a **"Thought Bubble" prop** over a character's head to explicitly discuss: "What does he *know* right now? Does he know the wolf is there? No." |
| **Visualization (Mental Imagery)**<br>*Explicit instruction on how to create a mental movie of text using structured descriptors.* | 1. **The 12-Structure Check:** When describing an image or story, students check off 12 specific elements to ensure detail: **What, Size, Color, Number, Shape, Where, Movement, Mood, Background, Perspective, When, Sound.** This prevents vague descriptions. |
| | 2. **Sketch-to-Stretch:** Read a sentence, have students sketch exactly what they visualized (focusing on the 12 elements), then compare sketches to the text to check accuracy. |
| **Experience First (Background Loading)**<br>*Ensure the student has a visual/experiential "hook" for a topic before expecting them to learn the text/content.* | 1. **Virtual Field Trip Pre-Load:** You cannot teach "The Trenches of WWI" if the student has never seen a trench. Hearing kids pick up context from movies/news; DHH kids often don't. Watch a **3-minute silent walkthrough video** of a trench *before* reading the text. |
| | 2. **The "Realia" Box:** For abstract units (e.g., Geometry or Ancient Rome), bring in a physical box of objects (a cone, a toga replica). Allow the student to **touch and manipulate** the object while learning the sign/label. This anchors the abstract word to a concrete sensation. |
| | 3. **Sequence Re-enactment:** Before writing a narrative, have the student **act out the sequence** physically or with puppets. DHH students often struggle with linear time (First, Then, Last). Physical movement cements the timeline better than a paper outline. |

### Domain H: Whanaungatanga & Engagement (Identity & Culture)
*Focus: The Foundation of Learning. Identity, belonging, cultural safety, and relationships (Whanaungatanga) as the primary drivers of engagement.*

| High-Leverage Practice & Teacher Definition | Teaching Ideas for DHH Students (Good Practice Examples) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Whanaungatanga (Relationships First)**<br>*Prioritising connection and relational trust before academic content. The student must feel 'seen' to learn.* | 1. **The Name Sign Protocol:** Explicitly teach the whole class the DHH student's **Name Sign** (if they have one and consent). Use it naturally and respectfully. Ensure the teacher knows and uses it correctly, validating the student's Deaf identity. |
| | 2. **Visual Pepeha/Mihi:** Create a visual or signed introduction (Pepeha) that includes the student's culture, family, and hearing journey. Display this in the classroom to validate their place in the whare. |
| | 3. **"Check-In" Routine:** Start the day/lesson with a quick **emotional check-in** using NZSL signs for feelings (e.g., Tired, Happy, Bored, Excited). This validates that their internal state matters to the teacher. |
| **Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy (Deafhood)**<br>*Validating Deaf culture and NZSL as a 'Taonga' (treasure), not a deficit to be fixed.* | 1. **Deaf Role Models:** Display posters or share stories of **successful Deaf/Hard of Hearing adults** (Deaf Gain). Discuss what these people can do *because* they are Deaf (e.g., "They have amazing visual attention"), flipping the script on disability. |
| | 2. **NZSL Visibility:** Celebrate **NZSL Week** explicitly, but also integrate signs into daily routines (e.g., "Good Morning," "Toilet," "Drink"). Normalise the language of the student so they are not the 'odd one out'. |
| | 3. **"The Deaf Lens":** When studying a topic (e.g., Sound, Communication, Society), explicitly ask: **"How might a Deaf person experience this?"** This validates their unique perspective as an expert view, not a missing view. |
| **Co-Design & Learner Agency**<br>*Involving the student in the design of their own learning support to build ownership.* | 1. **"Rate the Lesson" (Access Check):** Ask the student to rate the **accessibility** of a lesson (1-5). "Did you see everything? Was it too fast?" Treat their feedback as expert data to improve your teaching, not as a complaint. |
| | 2. **Mode of Output Choice:** Allow the student to choose how they show their learning: **Signed Video, Written Text, Drawing, or Drama.** Value the *message* over the *medium* (unless the specific goal is English writing). |
| | 3. **The "Safe Break" Signal:** Agree on a specific, non-verbal signal for **"My brain is full / I need a listening break."** Allow the student to take 5 minutes of visual/auditory silence without penalty. |

## Phase 2: Explicit Distinction for Consistent Teaching of Vocabulary
*Focus: Moving from teacher-led access to student-led ownership.*

| **Consistent teaching of vocabulary**<br>*Transition from teacher-created displays to student-owned journals to build independent vocabulary mastery.* | 1. **Permanent Word Wall:** The Word Wall is **categorized by subject/topic** and includes the word, a clear picture, and the NZSL sign (or a code/link to the sign). This is a **static, shared classroom resource.** | 1. **Vocabulary Journal:** The student maintains a **personal, alphabetized notebook** where they log new words. Entries include: **Word, Definition in simple language, A Drawing, and A Sentence** using the word correctly in context. |
| | 2. **"Word of the Day" Routine:** Dedicate 1 minute daily to introducing one **high-utility word** using a **visual word map** (definition, synonyms, antonyms, parts of speech). The teacher models the word, and the class repeats the sign/word. | 2. **Self-Correction & Reference:** Encourage students to **highlight an unfamiliar word** while reading or writing, **cross-reference** their vocabulary journal or the word wall *independently*, and then **write the definition** in the margin of the text. |
| | 3. **Interactive Word Games:** Use **visually engaging games** (e.g., matching the word to the picture/sign, using dry-erase markers to "fish" words off a desktop map) for **overexposure and repetition** of the word's form and meaning. | 3. **"Use the New Word" Challenge:** Set a **specific goal** to use 3 new vocabulary words in their written or signed work for a specific task. They must **circle or underline** the words they used to demonstrate mastery of the word in a new context. |
