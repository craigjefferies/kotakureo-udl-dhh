# Domain 3: Learning Design & Problem-Solving Architecture

**Context:**  
This domain defines the **Pedagogical Layer**—how we structure learning to make thinking visible and concepts tangible. It combines **Explicit Teaching** (The "How") with **Symbolic & Mathematical Structure** (The "What").

The core logic:
> If you can't see the thinking, you can't copy it. If the abstract structure isn't made concrete, it remains noise.

We combine **Explicit Scaffolding** (Domain 3A) with **Concrete-to-Abstract Bridging** (Domain 3B).

---

## Subdomain 3A: Explicit Teaching & Scaffolding
*Focus: Making expert thinking visible and providing stepwise pathways to independence.*

### Strategy Node: The Gradual Release (I Do-We Do-You Do)

<metadata>
id: dom_d_gradual_release
name: Explicit Modeling & Scaffolding
type: instructional_framework
target_constraint: ["learned_helplessness", "task_paralysis", "mimicry_without_understanding"]
triggers: ["can't do it alone", "waits for help", "copies friends", "stuck", "helpless", "needs constant prompting"]
complexity: high
time_required: full_lesson_structure
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
DHH students miss incidental instructions and "overheard" thinking. Without explicit modeling, they mimic products without understanding processes.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Scripted Gradual Release"**
1.  **I Do (Model):** Teacher thinks aloud (signed/captioned) and writes steps. "Watch my brain work."
2.  **We Do (Guide):** Shared task. Students prompt the teacher on next steps.
3.  **You Do (Independent):** Students work with the visual step-list/scaffold visible.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student refers to step list; can explain *how* they solved it.
*   *Failure:* Student waits for help immediately; copies neighbour.

**Age/Stage Variations:**
*   **Primary (Y0-6):** Physical modelling with large props. "My Turn, Your Turn" chanting.
*   **Secondary (Y7-13):** Annotated worked examples on handouts. Video tutorials of the "I Do" phase for re-watching.

### Strategy Node: Worked Examples & Faded Scaffolds

<metadata>
id: dom_d_worked_examples
name: Worked Examples with Fading Support
type: task_design_strategy
target_constraint: ["cognitive_overload", "random_guessing", "over_prompting"]
triggers: ["overwhelmed", "guesses answers", "blank page syndrome", "too hard", "doesn't know where to start"]
complexity: medium
time_required: planning_plus_in_class
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Cognitive overload from trying to learn new content + new process simultaneously.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Faded Examples"**
1.  **Full Example:** Show a completed, annotated problem.
2.  **Faded Example:** Give a problem with some steps done, some blank. Student fills gaps.
3.  **Problem:** Student solves from scratch.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student talks through missing steps; transitions to independent work smoothly.
*   *Failure:* Student guesses; overwhelmed by blank page.

### Strategy Node: Non-Examples & Boundary Conditions

<metadata>
id: dom_d_non_examples
name: Teaching with Non-Examples & Boundaries
type: conceptual_clarification
target_constraint: ["fuzzy_concepts", "over_generalisation", "misclassification"]
triggers: ["confused concepts", "mixes things up", "doesn't know difference", "fuzzy understanding", "calls everything the same"]
complexity: medium
time_required: mini_lessons_plus_practice
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Concepts remain "fuzzy" because students don't know where the category ends.

**High-Leverage Practice: "This, Not That"**
1.  **Contrast:** Show examples (Triangle) vs Non-Examples (Open shape, curved side).
2.  **Boundary:** "Why is this NOT a triangle?"
3.  **Sort:** Students sort items into Yes/No categories.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Explains *why* something doesn't fit; defines boundaries accurately.
*   *Failure:* Over-generalises (calls all 4-sided shapes squares).

### Strategy Node: Error Analysis (Productive Struggle)

<metadata>
id: dom_d_error_analysis
name: Error Analysis & Productive Struggle
type: reasoning_strategy
target_constraint: ["fear_of_mistakes", "hidden_misconceptions", "teacher_over_correction"]
triggers: ["afraid of mistakes", "hides work", "teacher fixes everything", "doesn't check work", "gives up easily"]
complexity: medium
time_required: built_into_tasks
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Mistakes are often hidden or fixed by adults, removing the learning opportunity.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Find, Fix, Explain"**
1.  **Fake Error:** Teacher presents a problem with a common mistake.
2.  **Analyze:** Students identify the error.
3.  **Explain:** "They added the denominators. They should have found a common one."

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Discusses errors openly; understands common pitfalls.
*   *Failure:* Hides mistakes; waits for teacher to correct.

### Strategy Node: Concept Linking & Graphic Organisers

<metadata>
id: dom_d_concept_linking
name: Concept Maps & Graphic Organisers
type: conceptual_scaffold
target_constraint: ["isolated_facts", "difficulty_seeing_big_picture", "poor_transfer_between_topics"]
triggers: ["isolated facts", "doesn't see big picture", "can't connect ideas", "rote learning", "misses context"]
complexity: medium
time_required: recurring_use
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Curriculum feels like disconnected facts. Relationships (cause-effect, hierarchy) are missed.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Map the Idea"**
1.  **Organisers:** Venn diagrams, Flowcharts, T-Charts.
2.  **Co-Construct:** Build the map during the lesson.
3.  **Retrieve:** Use the map to summarise or review.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Uses maps to structure answers; sees connections between topics.
*   *Failure:* Maps used as one-off worksheets; knowledge remains siloed.

### Strategy Node: Spiral Review & Retrieval

<metadata>
id: dom_d_spiral
name: Spiral Review & Retrieval for DHH
type: memory_support
target_constraint: ["forgetting_previous_work", "fragile_learning", "topic_siloing"]
triggers: ["forgets everything", "knew it yesterday", "fragile memory", "gaps in learning", "brain sieve"]
complexity: medium
time_required: ongoing_short_slots
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Gaps in learning (absences, fatigue) lead to fragile retention.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Little and Often"**
1.  **Warm-Ups:** First 5 mins = review of last week/month.
2.  **Visual Cues:** Use images/signs to trigger memory.
3.  **Cumulative:** New tasks require old skills.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Recalls prior learning; less "I forgot everything".
*   *Failure:* Content taught once and dropped; rapid decay of knowledge.

## Subdomain 3B: Symbolic & Mathematical Structure
*Focus: Making abstract systems (Maths, Code) concrete and visual.*

### Strategy Node: Visualizing Place Value (14 vs 40)

<metadata>
id: dom_f_place_value
name: Place Value Structure & The "Teen/Ty" Trap
type: conceptual_scaffold
target_constraint: ["auditory_confusion_14_40", "abstract_symbol_blindness", "magnitude_error"]
triggers: ["confuses numbers", "writes 41 for 14", "maths struggle", "place value issues", "teen ty confusion"]
complexity: medium
time_required: continuous_habit
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
"Fourteen" and "Forty" sound alike. DHH students confuse them without structural understanding.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Structure over Sound"**
1.  **Concrete:** Build it. 14 = 1 ten + 4 ones. 40 = 4 tens.
2.  **Visual:** Colour code Tens (Blue) and Ones (Green).
3.  **Logic:** "Teens = Additive (10+4)", "Tys = Multiplicative (4x10)".

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Distinguishes 14/40 correctly; explains using place value structure.
*   *Failure:* Guesses based on lipreading; confuses magnitude.

**Age/Stage Variations:**
*   **Primary (Y0-6):** Bundling sticks (10s vs 1s). Numicon shapes.
*   **Secondary (Y7-13):** Scientific notation ($1.4 \times 10^1$ vs $4.0 \times 10^1$). Linking to metric prefixes (deca vs deci).

### Strategy Node: Fraction as Operator

<metadata>
id: dom_f_fraction_operator
name: Fraction as Action (Operator) & Structure
type: conceptual_scaffold
target_constraint: ["fraction_misconception", "whole_number_bias", "denominator_confusion"]
triggers: ["doesn't get fractions", "thinks 1/8 is big", "guesses operations", "pizza only", "fraction fear"]
complexity: high
time_required: multi_lesson_sequence
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Fractions seen only as "shaded shapes", not numbers or operators.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Shape, Set, Line"**
1.  **Multiple Views:** Show fraction as Shape (pizza), Set (1/2 of 8), and Number Line (position).
2.  **Operator:** "Find 1/2 of..." means "Divide by 2".
3.  **Inverse Rule:** Bigger denominator = Smaller piece (Visualise it!).

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Solves fractions of sets; places fractions on number line.
*   *Failure:* "1/8 is bigger than 1/4 because 8 is big."

### Strategy Node: Bar Models for Word Problems

<metadata>
id: dom_f_bar_models
name: Bar Models & Visual Equations
type: problem_solving_structure
target_constraint: ["word_problem_anxiety", "operation_choice_errors", "hidden_structure_of_problems"]
triggers: ["hates word problems", "guesses plus or minus", "can't read math questions", "word problem struggle"]
complexity: medium
time_required: regular_use
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Word problems hide maths in language. Students guess operations.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Draw the Bar"**
1.  **Visualize:** Draw bars for Part-Part-Whole or Comparison.
2.  **Label:** Fill in knowns and unknowns.
3.  **Solve:** Choose operation based on the visual model.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Draws model before calculating; chooses correct operation.
*   *Failure:* Grabs numbers and adds them regardless of context.

**Age/Stage Variations:**
*   **Primary (Y0-6):** Physical blocks to represent the bar. Drawing on mini-whiteboards.
*   **Secondary (Y7-13):** Digital bar modelling tools. Using algebra tiles to transition to $x + y = z$.

### Strategy Node: Concrete–Pictorial–Abstract (CPA)

<metadata>
id: dom_f_cpa
name: CPA Sequences with High Visual Fidelity
type: instructional_sequence
target_constraint: ["jumping_to_abstract_too_fast", "fragile_procedural_knowledge", "disconnect_between_materials_and_symbols"]
triggers: ["can't do abstract math", "needs blocks", "doesn't understand symbols", "lost in formulas", "needs concrete"]
complexity: high
time_required: unit_length
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Jumping to symbols too fast. Disconnect between "playing with blocks" and "doing maths".

**High-Leverage Practice: "Visual Fidelity"**
1.  **Concrete:** Do it with materials.
2.  **Pictorial:** Draw it *exactly* as it looked (fidelity).
3.  **Abstract:** Map symbols to the drawing.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Explains symbols using concrete examples; moves fluently between stages.
*   *Failure:* Can't link equation to materials; sees them as separate subjects.

### Strategy Node: Patterning & Generalisation (Algebra)

<metadata>
id: dom_f_patterning
name: Visual Patterns & General Rules
type: algebraic_thinking_support
target_constraint: ["weak_generalisation", "rule_memorisation_without_reasons", "difficulty_with_formulas"]
triggers: ["can't do algebra", "memorizes rules", "doesn't see patterns", "formulas are magic", "no logic"]
complexity: medium
time_required: recurring_short_tasks
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Algebra rules memorised without understanding the pattern.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Pattern to Rule"**
1.  **Build:** Grow a pattern (3 blocks, 5 blocks, 7 blocks).
2.  **Table:** Record the numbers. Spot the difference (+2).
3.  **Rule:** Connect "+2" to "2n".

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Predicts future stages; explains formula using the pattern.
*   *Failure:* Memorises "2n+1" without knowing what n is.

### Strategy Node: Maths Talk Frames

<metadata>
id: dom_f_maths_talk
name: Maths Discourse Frames (NZSL ↔ English)
type: language_support
target_constraint: ["one_word_answers", "difficulty_explaining_reasoning", "limited_maths_vocabulary"]
triggers: ["one word answers", "can't explain math", "knows answer but can't say why", "silent in math"]
complexity: medium
time_required: ongoing
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Maths reasoning requires specific language often missed by DHH learners.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Talk Frames"**
1.  **Stems:** "I agree because...", "I think the answer is...".
2.  **NZSL:** Teach signs for reasoning (BECAUSE, SAME-AS, DIFFERENT).
3.  **Roles:** Explainer, Checker.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Uses frames to justify answers; participates in maths discussions.
*   *Failure:* Gives number answer only; cannot explain reasoning.
