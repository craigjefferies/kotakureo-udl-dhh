# Domain 3: Learning Design & Problem-Solving Architecture

**Non-negotiables**
- **Visible Thinking:** Never ask student to solve without showing *process* first.
- **Routine is King:** Same visual routine for every task.
- **Concrete First:** Materials/visuals before abstract symbols.
- **No "Guessing Games":** Teach strategy to find answer.
- **Gradual Release:** I Do (Model) → We Do (Guide) → You Do (Independent).
- **Error Analysis:** Celebrate mistakes as "learning data".

**Triage flow**
1. **Process Check:** Knows *how* to start? (Routine)
2. **Concept Check:** Understands *maths/text* structure? (Concrete/Visual)
3. **Scaffold Check:** Support visible on desk?
4. **Independence Check:** Can do "You Do" phase?

**Routing cue**
Use this domain after concept and language are secure (Domain 2), when the learner needs help with process, structure, or independence.

**Problem/Barrier**
Fractions seen as "shaded shapes", not numbers/operators. "Whole number bias".

**High-Leverage Practice: Shape, Set, Line**
1. **Views:** Shape, Set, Line.
2. **Action:** "Find 1/2" = "Divide by 2".
3. **Inverse:** Bigger denominator = Smaller piece.

**Evidence Guide**
