# Domain A: The Bi-Literacy Bridge (NZSL ↔ English)

**Context:** These strategy nodes define the logic for bridging Manual Communication (NZSL) and Printed English. They focus on Orthographic Mapping, Visual Morphology, and Syntactic Scaffolding.

## Strategy Node: Visual Grammar Mechanics (Morphology)

<metadata>
id: dom_a_morphology
name: Visual Grammar & Morphology Markers
type: intervention_strategy
target_constraint: ["auditory_blindness_to_s", "morphological_awareness", "missing_plurals", "verb_tense_errors"]
complexity: low
time_required: instant
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
DHH learners often have "auditory blindness" to high-frequency, low-energy sounds (like 's', 'ed', 't'). If they cannot hear it, they do not internalize the grammar rule. We must replace the *auditory* cue with a *visual* cue.

### Implementation Spec (Gradual Release)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do)**
    * Teacher writes a sentence on the board.
    * **Technique A (Spotter):** Teacher circles the suffix (e.g., 's') in **Red** while explicitly signing the grammar marker.
    * **Technique B (Traffic Lights):** Teacher codes word parts: **Green** (Prefix/Start) + **Black** (Root) + **Red** (Suffix/Stop). (e.g., *Un-kind-ly*).
    * Teacher thinks aloud: *"I see the Red 'ly', so I know this tells me 'how' it happened."*
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do)**
    * Teacher holds up a "Plural S" card or "Red Light" card.
    * Class scans a text together. When they find the grammar marker, they physically signal (hold up card/snake hand).
    * Teacher highlights the word on the board to confirm.
    * **Technique C (The Chain):** Teacher points to the written word (Print), signs it (NZSL), fingerspells it (Manual Alphabet), and points back to the word (Print). This sequence locks the concept to the orthography.
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * Students use green/red highlighters on their own worksheet to "code" the words *before* answering questions.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Teacher uses a consistent colour code (e.g., Red always = Suffix).
    * Students physically signal *when* they see the grammar marker.
    * The visual highlighting happens on the board *before* the meaning is discussed.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Teacher relies on speaking the ending louder (auditory strategy).
    * Teacher circles the *whole word* instead of isolating the suffix.
    * Teacher corrects the error verbally ("You forgot the S") without writing/signing the correction.

## Strategy Node: Shape Coding (Syntactic Patterning)

<metadata>
id: dom_a_shape_coding
name: Shape Coding / Patterning
type: intervention_strategy
target_constraint: ["sentence_structure_issues", "word_order_confusion", "syntax_mapping"]
complexity: medium
time_required: preparation_needed
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
English syntax is linear; NZSL syntax is spatial. DHH students often struggle to map the order. Assigning geometric shapes to parts of speech (e.g., Triangle = Noun, Circle = Verb) allows students to "build" the sentence structure physically before worrying about vocabulary.

### Implementation Spec (Gradual Release)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do)**
    * Teacher displays the "Key" (e.g., Blue Triangle = Who/Noun, Red Circle = Doing/Verb).
    * Teacher places large magnetic shapes on the board *silently*.
    * Teacher signs the concept into the shape, then writes the word inside it.
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do)**
    * Teacher places a pattern on the board (e.g., Triangle - Circle - Triangle).
    * Teacher asks: *"We need a Doing Word (Red Circle) here. Who can give me one?"*
    * Students offer words, and the class decides if they fit the "shape rule."
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * Students arrange their own physical cut-out shapes on their desk to form a sentence.
    * Students write the words *inside* or under their shapes.
    * **Exit Ticket:** Student draws the shapes above their written sentence to prove the structure.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Students manipulate the shapes *before* writing the words.
    * The "Key" is visible on the wall/desk.
    * Teacher corrects the *pattern* ("You are missing a Red Circle") rather than the word.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Shapes are drawn *after* the sentence is written (decorative, not structural).
    * Inconsistent colour/shape coding (changes from lesson to lesson).
    * Teacher tells the student the word order instead of letting the shape guide them.

## Strategy Node: Language Chaining

<metadata>
id: dom_a_chaining
name: Language Chaining & Anchoring
type: instructional_routine
target_constraint: ["vocabulary_retention", "print_to_sign_mapping", "fleeting_attention"]
complexity: medium
time_required: continuous_habit
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
A sign is fleeting (gone in a second); text is static. Chaining creates a neurological bridge by "sandwiching" the text between signs.

### Implementation Spec (Gradual Release)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do)**
    * Teacher introduces a key term (e.g., "Volcano").
    * Teacher performs the sequence explicitly: **Sign** (Concept) $\to$ **Fingerspell/Point** (Text) $\to$ **Sign** (Concept).
    * Teacher keeps a finger anchored on the text while signing the explanation.
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do)**
    * Teacher signs a word.
    * Students must find the word on the Word Wall or board and **point to it**.
    * Teacher confirms by signing the word again.
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * During reading, the student pauses at a bold word, signs it, fingerspells it (or looks at the spelling), and signs it again before continuing.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Teacher touches the board/book *while* the student looks.
    * The sequence ends with the Concept (Sign) to confirm meaning.
    * Fingerspelling is used to highlight internal orthography.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * **"SimCom" Slop:** Teacher tries to sign and speak/point simultaneously.
    * **Disconnection:** Teacher signs "Volcano" while standing away from the word.
    * **Speed:** Moving too fast for the student to shift gaze from Face $\to$ Text $\to$ Face.

## Strategy Node: Language Experience Approach (LEA)

<metadata>
id: dom_a_lea
name: Language Experience Approach (Do-Discuss-Draft)
type: lesson_structure
target_constraint: ["low_reading_comprehension", "background_knowledge_gap", "disengagement"]
complexity: high
time_required: full_lesson
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
You cannot read what you do not understand. LEA ensures 100% comprehension of the *content* (because they just lived it) so the brain can focus entirely on *decoding the text*.

### Implementation Spec (Gradual Release)
* **Phase 1: The Experience (I Do / We Do Together)**
    * Class participates in a shared, concrete activity (e.g., a science experiment, a walk, baking).
    * *Critically:* No writing happens here, only experiencing and signing/talking.
* **Phase 2: The Draft (We Do)**
    * Teacher asks: *"What did we do first?"*
    * Students sign/say their ideas.
    * Teacher models translating that sign into **written English** on the board, thinking aloud about the grammar.
* **Phase 3: The Reading (You Do)**
    * The class reads the co-created text together.
    * Students copy the text into their books and illustrate it (proving comprehension).

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * The text generated uses the students' own vocabulary level.
    * The "Experience" phase happens immediately before the writing.
    * Teacher explicitly validates the student's signed idea before writing it.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Teacher writes the summary *before* the lesson (pre-written text).
    * Teacher corrects the students' ideas to make them "sound better," losing the student's voice.
    * The text is created without a shared physical experience.

## Strategy Node: Pre-Teaching Critical Content

<metadata>
id: dom_a_preteach
name: Semantic Pre-Teaching & Visual Analogies
type: preparation_strategy
target_constraint: ["cognitive_overload", "slow_processing_speed", "vocabulary_gap"]
complexity: medium
time_required: 24h_advance
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
DHH students cannot "pick up" vocabulary incidentally. If they encounter new words *and* new concepts simultaneously, cognitive load creates a bottleneck. We prime the brain with the vocabulary 24 hours prior.

### Implementation Spec (Gradual Release)
* **Phase 1: Setup (I Do - Teacher/Aide)**
    * 24 hours before the lesson, the teacher/aide introduces the core concept (e.g., "Cell Membrane") using a concrete **Visual Analogy** (e.g., "It is like a Screen Door").
    * Teacher displays the "Word Map" (Sign + Image + Word).
* **Phase 2: Feature Analysis (We Do)**
    * Teacher and student complete a Semantic Feature Analysis chart together.
    * *"Is a Screen Door hard? No. Is a Cell Membrane hard? No."*
* **Phase 3: Application (You Do)**
    * When the main lesson starts the next day, the student physically retrieves the Word Map/Analogy card and places it on their desk to support their learning.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Pre-teaching happens *before* the main lesson (e.g., with a Teacher Aide or homework).
    * Analogies use concrete, physical objects the student knows.
    * Visuals remain visible during the main lesson.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * "Pre-teaching" happens in the first 5 mins of the main lesson (too late).
    * Definitions are given as text-only (dictionary definitions).
    * The analogy is purely verbal without an image.

## Strategy Node: Vocabulary Ownership System (Wall to Wallet)

<metadata>
id: dom_a_vocab_system
name: Consistent Vocabulary Routine
type: longitudinal_strategy
target_constraint: ["vocabulary_gap", "passive_learning", "lack_of_retention", "incidental_learning_failure"]
complexity: medium
time_required: daily_routine
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
DHH students do not "pick up" vocabulary from the air (incidental learning). If words stay on the wall, they remain "The Teacher's Words." To achieve mastery, we must transition the student from using an external scaffold (Word Wall) to an internal tool (Personal Journal).

### Implementation Spec (Environment -> Routine -> Ownership)
* **Phase 1: Teacher Setup (The Word Wall)**
    * **Static Resource:** Teacher maintains a permanent Word Wall categorised by topic.
    * **The "Triad":** Every entry must have: **The Word + A Picture + The NZSL Sign**.
    * **Rule:** It is not a decoration. It is a reference tool used during lessons.
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (Word of the Day)**
    * **1-Minute Routine:** Teacher introduces one *High-Utility* word using a Visual Map (Definition, Synonym, Antonym).
    * **Game-Based Repetition:** Students use dry-erase markers to "fish" words off the map or match signs to pictures.
    * **Goal:** Overexposure to the word's form and meaning.
* **Phase 3: Student Autonomy (The Vocabulary Journal)**
    * **The "Wallet":** Student maintains a personal, alphabetized notebook (their "Word Wallet").
    * **The Entry:** Student logs the word with a **Simple Definition, a Drawing, and a Sentence**.
    * **The "Use It" Challenge:** Student sets a goal to use 3 new words in their writing and **highlighter/circle** them to prove mastery.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Students look at their Journals *before* asking the teacher for a spelling/sign.
    * The Word Wall includes the *Sign* (not just text).
    * Student writing has "Self-Correction" marks where they swapped a basic word for a new vocabulary word.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * **Wallpaper:** The Word Wall exists but is never pointed to or used.
    * **Copy-Paste:** Student copies the dictionary definition into their journal without understanding it.
    * No connection between the "Word of the Day" and the writing task.

## Strategy Node: Knowledge Extension (Schema Building)

<metadata>
id: dom_a_extension
name: Graphic Organizers & Concept Anchors
type: cognitive_scaffold
target_constraint: ["poor_information_organization", "disconnected_knowledge", "recall_failure"]
complexity: medium
time_required: 5-10_mins
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
DHH students often store facts in isolation. We must force the brain to visually link new learning to prior knowledge (schema activation) using spatial layouts.

### Implementation Spec (Gradual Release)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do)**
    * **Option A (Bridge Map):** Teacher draws a map linking "New Concept" to "Old Concept" with a relating factor (e.g., *"Igneous is a type of Rock"*).
    * **Option B (Concept Tagging):** Teacher writes the new word (*Photosynthesis*) and physically draws an arrow to a synonym from last term (*$\to$ Plant Energy*) written below it.
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do)**
    * **Review Card Link:** Teacher holds up a physical flashcard from the *previous unit*.
    * Teacher asks: *"How does this Old Card connect to our New Topic?"*
    * Students sign/discuss the connection before the lesson moves on.
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * Students draw their own empty map or tag their own notes with "Synonym Arrows" before summarizing the text.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Old concepts are physically visible (cards/maps) next to new concepts.
    * The "Relating Factor" (the rule) is written on the bridge.
    * Visuals/Drawings are included inside the map, not just words.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Teacher hands out a filled-in worksheet (no thinking required).
    * Teacher asks "Do you remember...?" (Auditory recall) without a visual prompt.
    * The map has no labels or relating factor.
