# Domain 2: Language & Cognitive Engine

**Non-negotiables**
- **Meaning First:** Never ask student to read/write English they can't sign/explain first.
- **Visual Grammar:** English grammar is invisible; make it visible (colour-coded).
- **No "Fake Reading":** Decoding without comprehension forbidden. Stop and check.
- **Pre-teach Vocab:** Academic terms front-loaded before lesson.
- **Explicit Bridging:** Explicitly link sign to written word.
- **Metacognition:** Safe way to say "I don't get it" (Traffic Lights).

**Triage flow**
1. **Concept Check:** Understands *idea* in strongest language (NZSL)?
2. **Bridge Check:** Maps idea to English word/sentence?
3. **Output Check:** Can manipulate idea (critical thinking) vs copying?
4. **Intervene:** 1 fails=teach concept. 2 fails=teach vocab/grammar. 3 fails=teach scaffolds.

## Subdomain 2A: The Bi-Literacy Bridge (NZSL ↔ English)

### Strategy Node: Visual Grammar Mechanics (Morphology)

<metadata>
id: dom_2a_morphology
title: Visual Grammar & Morphology Markers
subdomain: 2A
trigger_signs: ["missing plurals", "no past tense -ed", "telegraphic writing", "writes like they speak"]
do_now_2min: Mark all 's' in Green and 'ed' in Blue.
build_20min: Teach "Morphology Monster": English eats ends, put them back.
success_looks_like: Self-corrects endings during drafting.
common_failure_mode: Verbal corrections ("Did you hear the 's'?").
admin_enabler: School-wide colour-coding policy.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
"Auditory blindness" to low-energy sounds (*-s, -ed*) leads to errors. If you can't hear it, you don't write it.

**High-Leverage Practice: Colour-Coded Morphology**
1. **Code:** Assign colours (Plural=Red, Past=Blue).
2. **Chain:** Sign concept -> Write words.
3. **Highlight:** Physically highlight 's' to confirm.
4. **Contrast:** "NZSL repeats sign; English adds 's'."

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* Checks work for "red bits".
- *Failure:* Teacher circles errors without explanation.

### Strategy Node: Orthographic Mapping with NZSL Anchors

<metadata>
id: dom_2a_orthographic
title: Orthographic Mapping with NZSL Anchors
subdomain: 2A
trigger_signs: ["guessing words", "slow reading", "visual shape guessing", "no phonics skills"]
do_now_2min: Finger-spell word. Sign meaning. Point to written word.
build_20min: "Sign-Sound-Spelling" wall for irregular words.
success_looks_like: Recognizes target words instantly.
common_failure_mode: Teaching "phonics only" without sound access.
admin_enabler: Phonics programs with visual/mouth-shape supports.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Standard phonics relies on auditory loop. DHH students need visual anchor to "glue" letters to meaning.

**High-Leverage Practice: Sign–Shape–Meaning**
1. **Anchor:** Sign meaning (NZSL) first.
2. **Map:** Finger-spell letter sequence.
3. **Shape:** Trace word shape.
4. **Context:** Put in sentence immediately.

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* Sees word, signs meaning immediately.
- *Failure:* Sounds out "h-o-u-s-e" but doesn't know meaning.

### Strategy Node: Language Experience Approach (LEA)

<metadata>
id: dom_2a_lea
title: NZSL-Based Language Experience Stories
subdomain: 2A
trigger_signs: ["hates writing", "blank page syndrome", "disconnect from text", "low vocabulary"]
do_now_2min: Photo of activity. Write one sentence together.
build_20min: Do activity. Discuss in NZSL. Co-write story.
success_looks_like: Reads back text because they lived it.
common_failure_mode: Generic prompts ("My Holiday") with no shared experience.
admin_enabler: Allow "experience trips".
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Disconnect between vivid visual life and static text. No English vocab for thoughts = shutdown.

**High-Leverage Practice: We Sign It, We Write It**
1. **Experience:** Do something real.
2. **Discuss:** Talk in NZSL. Capture vocab.
3. **Scribe:** Write student's ideas in English.
4. **Read:** Student reads thoughts back.

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* High engagement; points to words and signs.
- *Failure:* Teacher writes text student doesn't understand.

### Strategy Node: Visual Sentence Framing (Syntax)

<metadata>
id: dom_2a_syntax
title: Visual Sentence Frames with NZSL Chaining
subdomain: 2A
trigger_signs: ["jumbled word order", "run-on sentences", "missing verbs", "signed english writing"]
do_now_2min: Write structure: [WHO] + [DID WHAT] + [WHERE].
build_20min: Laminated "sentence strips" to arrange.
success_looks_like: Uses frame to build coherent sentence.
common_failure_mode: Correcting every error (bleeding red ink).
admin_enabler: None.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
NZSL (Topic-Comment) syntax differs from English (SVO). "Gloss" writing results in jumbled English.

**High-Leverage Practice: Frame & Fill**
1. **Frame:** Empty slots: [Subject] [Verb] [Object].
2. **Sign:** Student signs idea.
3. **Map:** "Which sign is Subject? Put here."
4. **Fill:** Write English words in slots.

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* Stops, checks frame, reorders words.
- *Failure:* Stream of consciousness, no punctuation.

build_20min: Pre-teach 5 key terms using 4-Part Card system.
success_looks_like: Uses academic term in NZSL and writing.
common_failure_mode: "Dictionary work" - copying definitions.
admin_enabler: Symbol software subscription.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Missed "overheard" vocabulary. Gaps in Tier 2/3 vocabulary.

**High-Leverage Practice: 4-Part Vocab Cards**

success_looks_like: Stops reading to process, signs summary.
common_failure_mode: Reading whole page without checking.
admin_enabler: None.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Decoding is not comprehension. "Barking at print" without mental model.

**High-Leverage Practice: Read–Sign–Summarise**
1. **Read:** Short chunk.
2. **Sign:** Translate to NZSL.
3. **Check:** Make sense? If not, re-read.

do_now_2min: "What are clues?" (Highlight). "What do they mean?"
build_20min: Model "Clue + Background Knowledge = Inference".
success_looks_like: Points to text evidence.
common_failure_mode: Asking "Why?" without teaching *how*.
admin_enabler: None.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Inference connects text clues with world knowledge. DHH students may lack incidental knowledge.

**High-Leverage Practice: Literal → Local → Global**
1. **Literal:** Find fact.
2. **Local:** Connect facts in paragraph.
3. **Global:** Connect text to world.
4. **Bridge:** Use NZSL to explain "hidden meaning".

subdomain: 2B
trigger_signs: ["slang in essays", "talks well but fails tests", "can't read textbooks"]
do_now_2min: "That's playground talk. How do we say it in 'Science talk'?"
build_20min: "Word Wall" with Social vs Academic equivalents.
success_looks_like: Swaps "blow up" for "explode/erupt".
common_failure_mode: Assuming fluent social signing = academic readiness.
admin_enabler: None.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
BICS (Social) develops naturally. CALP (Academic) must be taught. DHH students often stuck at BICS.

**High-Leverage Practice: Two Ways to Say It**
1. **Identify:** Catch informal phrase.
2. **Translate:** Give academic term.
3. **Practice:** Use academic term in sentence.

**Evidence Guide**

success_looks_like: Explains *why* sentence is correct.
common_failure_mode: Abstract grammar lectures without visuals.
admin_enabler: None.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**

2. **Contrast:** "Said 'Fine', thought 'Angry'."
3. **Infer:** "Why did he lie?"

3. **Release:** Remove frame slowly.

**Evidence Guide**
