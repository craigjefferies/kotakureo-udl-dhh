# Domain 2: Language & Cognitive Engine

**Context:**  
This domain powers the learner's ability to **process, express, and manipulate complex ideas**. It bridges the gap between languages (NZSL ↔ English) and elevates thinking from surface recall to deep critical analysis.

The core logic:
> Access (Domain 1) lets the signal in. Domain 2 provides the **engine** to decode that signal (Language) and the **gears** to drive deep thinking (Cognition).

We combine **The Bi-Literacy Bridge** (Domain 2A) with **Critical Thinking & Metalinguistics** (Domain 2B).

---

## Subdomain 2A: The Bi-Literacy Bridge (NZSL ↔ English)
*Focus: Explicitly connecting the visual language of NZSL with the written code of English.*

### Strategy Node: Visual Grammar Mechanics (Morphology)

<metadata>
id: dom_a_morphology
name: Visual Grammar & Morphology Markers
type: intervention_strategy
target_constraint: ["auditory_blindness_to_s", "morphological_awareness", "missing_plurals", "verb_tense_errors"]
triggers: ["misses endings", "no plurals", "writes like they speak", "grammar errors", "verb tense wrong", "leaves off s"]
complexity: low
time_required: instant
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
"Auditory blindness" to low-energy sounds (*-s, -ed*) leads to grammatical errors in reading/writing.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Colour-Coded Morphology"**
1.  **Colour Code:** Red for plural *-s*, Blue for past *-ed*.
2.  **NZSL Chain:** Sign CAT -> Sign THREE -> Write "Three Cats" (highlight 's').
3.  **Explicit Contrast:** "In NZSL we sign 'FINISH'; in English we write '-ed'."

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student self-corrects endings; explains meaning of *-s/-ed*.
*   *Failure:* Student omits endings consistently; teacher corrects without visual explanation.

**Age/Stage Variations:**
*   **Primary (Y0-6):** Physical Lego blocks (Red block = 's', Blue block = 'ed'). "Morphology Monster" game.
*   **Secondary (Y7-13):** Highlighting text in Google Docs (Find/Replace all 'ed' with blue). Explicit analysis of scientific suffixes (-tion, -ology).

### Strategy Node: Orthographic Mapping with NZSL Anchors

<metadata>
id: dom_a_orthographic
name: Orthographic Mapping with NZSL Anchors
type: decoding_intervention
target_constraint: ["sight_word_blur", "slow_reading_rate", "weak_phonological_awareness"]
triggers: ["can't sound out", "guesses words", "slow reading", "doesn't know phonics", "visual reader"]
complexity: medium
time_required: repeated_short_sessions
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Lack of phonological loop makes "sounding out" inefficient. Words are treated as random pictures.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Sign–Shape–Sound–Meaning"**
1.  **Anchor:** Sign the meaning (NZSL).
2.  **Shape:** Trace word shape/outline.
3.  **Map:** Link letters to mouth shape/sound (where accessible).
4.  **Context:** Use in sentence.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Recognises target words instantly; sorts by pattern (e.g., wh- words).
*   *Failure:* Reads word as new every time; relies solely on fingerspelling.

### Strategy Node: Language Experience Approach (LEA)

<metadata>
id: dom_a_lea
name: NZSL-Based Language Experience Stories
type: reading_writing_bridge
target_constraint: ["limited_background_knowledge", "weak_connection_between_sign_and_print", "low_motivation_for_reading"]
triggers: ["hates reading", "no connection to text", "low vocabulary", "can't write stories", "reluctant writer"]
complexity: medium
time_required: 20-40_min_session
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Disconnect between student's lived experience (often visual/signed) and static text.

**High-Leverage Practice: "We Sign It, We Write It"**
1.  **Experience:** Do an activity together. Discuss in NZSL.
2.  **Co-Construct:** Write the story together in English, translating from student's signs.
3.  **Read:** Read back the text, linking English words to the signs used.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* High engagement; student retells story in both languages.
*   *Failure:* Text unrelated to student experience; no explicit sign-print linking.

### Strategy Node: Visual Sentence Framing (Syntax)

<metadata>
id: dom_a_syntax
name: Visual Sentence Frames with NZSL Chaining
type: writing_scaffold
target_constraint: ["run_on_sentences", "missing_subjects_or_verbs", "unclear_sentence_boundaries"]
triggers: ["jumbled sentences", "words in wrong order", "run-on sentences", "missing verbs", "confused grammar"]
complexity: medium
time_required: modelled_lessons_plus_independent_practice
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
English syntax (SVO) differs from NZSL (Topic-Comment). Students produce "signed English" or run-on sentences.

**High-Leverage Practice: "NZSL → Frame → Fill"**
1.  **Sign Idea:** Student signs concept.
2.  **Frame:** Teacher provides visual frame (e.g., "Yesterday, [Who] [Action] [Where].").
3.  **Fill:** Student maps signs to English slots. Colour-code Subject/Verb.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student uses frames independently; sentences become complete.
*   *Failure:* Writing is unpunctuated stream; teacher rewrites for student.

### Strategy Node: NZSL-Linked Vocabulary Systems

<metadata>
id: dom_a_vocab
name: NZSL-Linked Vocabulary Systems
type: vocabulary_intervention
target_constraint: ["limited_word_bank", "difficulty_with_academic_vocabulary", "weak_category_knowledge"]
triggers: ["doesn't know words", "limited vocabulary", "can't explain meaning", "forgets new words", "needs visuals"]
complexity: medium
time_required: daily_short_practice
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Limited incidental vocabulary acquisition. Academic terms are often unknown.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Sign–Picture–Word–Category"**
1.  **4-Part Card:** Sign + Picture + English Word + Category.
2.  **Pre-Teach:** Front-load 5-8 key words before a unit.
3.  **Active Use:** Sorting games, matching tasks.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Uses new words in context; sorts by category.
*   *Failure:* Cannot match sign to word; vocabulary taught once and forgotten.

**Age/Stage Variations:**
*   **Primary (Y0-6):** Real objects in a "Vocab Box". Picture matching games.
*   **Secondary (Y7-13):** Digital Glossary (Quizlet/Anki) with sign videos. "Frayer Model" for subject-specific terms (Definition, Image, Example, Non-Example).

### Strategy Node: NZSL Retell for Comprehension

<metadata>
id: dom_a_comprehension
name: NZSL Retell as a Comprehension Strategy
type: reading_comprehension_support
target_constraint: ["surface_level_reading", "weak_inferencing", "limited_understanding_of_text_structure"]
triggers: ["reads but doesn't understand", "can't answer questions", "fake reading", "robot reading", "no recall"]
complexity: medium
time_required: ongoing_during_reading_blocks
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Decoding $\neq$ Comprehension. Students may read words but miss the "movie in the mind".

**High-Leverage Practice: "Read–Sign–Summarise"**
1.  **Chunk:** Read short section.
2.  **Retell:** Student retells in NZSL. Teacher checks understanding.
3.  **Summarise:** Write 1-2 English sentences to capture the retell.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Accurate NZSL retell; written summary captures main idea.
*   *Failure:* Retell misses key events; student copies text without understanding.

### Strategy Node: NZSL–English Code-Switching Awareness

<metadata>
id: dom_a_codeswitch
name: NZSL–English Code-Switching & Register Awareness
type: metalinguistic_awareness
target_constraint: ["mixing_nzsl_and_english_structures", "inappropriate_register_in_writing", "confusion_about_language_boundaries"]
triggers: ["writes in NZSL order", "confused languages", "informal writing", "mixes grammar", "signed english"]
complexity: medium
time_required: integrated_into_lessons
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Confusion between language systems and registers (formal vs informal).

**High-Leverage Practice: "The Language Line"**
1.  **Compare:** Show NZSL sentence vs English sentence. Discuss differences (word order, grammar).
2.  **Register:** Sort phrases into "Casual/Text" vs "Formal/School".
3.  **Explicit Switch:** "Now we are writing for the Principal (Formal English)."

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Explains differences between NZSL/English; adjusts register.
*   *Failure:* Writing mixes grammars randomly; no awareness of audience.

**Age/Stage Variations:**
*   **Primary (Y0-6):** "Playground Talk" vs "Mat Talk". Sorting pictures of people into "Formal" (Principal) vs "Casual" (Friend).
*   **Secondary (Y7-13):** Analyzing text messages vs essays. Explicit instruction on "Academic English" as a separate dialect.

triggers: ["talks fine but fails tests", "slang in essays", "can't do academic writing", "conversational only"]
complexity: medium
time_required: ongoing_mini_lessons
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Gap between social language (BICS) and academic language (CALP).

**High-Leverage Practice: "Two Ways to Say It"**
1.  **T-Chart:** "Everyday Talk" vs "School Talk".
2.  **Translate:** Convert "The volcano blew up" -> "The volcano erupted."
3.  **Link:** Show how NZSL register also changes (formal signing vs chat).

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Identifies academic register; upgrades vocabulary in writing.
*   *Failure:* Uses slang in formal essays; confused by exam language.

### Strategy Node: Reciprocal Teaching with NZSL Scaffolds

<metadata>
id: dom_g_reciprocal
name: NZSL-Supported Reciprocal Teaching
type: comprehension_strategy
target_constraint: ["passive_reading", "limited_question_asking", "difficulty_monitoring_own_comprehension"]
triggers: ["passive reader", "doesn't ask questions", "waiting for teacher", "surface learning", "bored reading"]
complexity: high
time_required: structured_group_sessions
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Passive reading habits. Difficulty monitoring own comprehension.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Sign-Led Roles"**
1.  **Roles:** Predictor, Questioner, Clarifier, Summariser.
2.  **Visual Cards:** NZSL prompts for each role.
3.  **Group Work:** Students take turns leading the text analysis using roles.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Independently uses strategies; asks clarifying questions.
*   *Failure:* Passive in groups; roles used superficially.

### Strategy Node: Metalinguistic Talk (Language as Lego)

<metadata>
id: dom_g_morphology_talk
name: Talking About Language: Morphology & Syntax
type: metalinguistic_awareness
target_constraint: ["limited_vocabulary_growth", "grammatical_errors_persisting", "difficulty_generalising_rules"]
triggers: ["keeps making same mistakes", "doesn't understand rules", "can't fix own work", "repeats errors"]
complexity: medium
time_required: regular_mini_lessons
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Language rules seen as arbitrary corrections rather than a system.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Language as Lego"**
1.  **Manipulatives:** Word parts (prefix, root, suffix) on cards.
2.  **Build/Break:** Physically move parts to change meaning (un-happy, happy-ness).
3.  **Meta-Talk:** Use NZSL signs for "verb", "noun", "past tense".

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Discusses language structure ("I need to add -ed"); generalises rules.
*   *Failure:* Cannot explain why a sentence is wrong; relies on teacher correction.

### Strategy Node: Theory of Mind & Perspective Taking

<metadata>
id: dom_g_theory_of_mind
name: Theory of Mind & Perspective Narratives
type: social_cognition_support
target_constraint: ["difficulty_inferencing_characters_thoughts", "literal_interpretation_of_texts", "social_misunderstandings"]
triggers: ["doesn't get characters", "misses the point", "socially awkward", "literal thinker", "misses sarcasm"]
complexity: medium
time_required: ongoing_in_reading_and_social_learning
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Missed incidental social talk leads to gaps in understanding others' mental states/intentions.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Thought Bubbles"**
1.  **Visuals:** Draw thought bubbles vs speech bubbles on characters.
2.  **Ask:** "What are they saying? What are they *thinking*?"
3.  **Role Play:** Act out misunderstandings in NZSL.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Infers hidden motives/feelings; explains social misunderstandings.
*   *Failure:* Literal interpretation only; misses sarcasm or deceit in stories.

### Strategy Node: Argumentation & Justification (PRE)

<metadata>
id: dom_g_argumentation
name: Structured Argumentation & Justification
type: reasoning_and_writing_support
target_constraint: ["opinion_only_responses", "weak_explanations", "difficulty_justifying_answers"]
triggers: ["weak arguments", "can't explain why", "simple opinions", "no evidence", "just says yes/no"]
complexity: high
time_required: ongoing_across_subjects
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Giving answers without reasons. Difficulty structuring an argument.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Point–Reason–Example (PRE)"**
1.  **Structure:** Point (I think...), Reason (Because...), Example (For instance...).
2.  **Visual Template:** Graphic organizer for PRE.
3.  **Model:** Teacher models argument in NZSL, then maps to English.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Uses "because/therefore"; supports opinions with evidence.
*   *Failure:* One-word answers; opinions stated as facts without backing.

### Strategy Node: Metacognitive Traffic Lights

<metadata>
id: dom_g_metacognition
name: Understanding Traffic Lights
type: self_monitoring_support
target_constraint: ["student_does_not_signal_confusion", "passive_compliance", "over_reliance_on_nodding"]
triggers: ["nods but doesn't understand", "hides confusion", "pretends to know", "afraid to ask", "compliance nod"]
complexity: low
time_required: routine_practice
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
The "Compliance Nod"—pretending to understand to avoid standing out.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Red–Orange–Green"**
1.  **Scale:** Green (I can teach it), Orange (I'm stuck on a bit), Red (I'm lost).
2.  **Routine:** Regular "show me your colour" checks.
3.  **Safety:** Praise "Red" responses as good learning behaviour.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student signals confusion honestly; stops the lesson to ask.
*   *Failure:* Student nods "Green" but cannot do the task.

### Strategy Node: Critical Literacy (Deaf Lens)

<metadata>
id: dom_g_critical_literacy
name: Critical Literacy with DHH Lived Experience

1.  **Question:** "Whose voice is missing? How is deafness represented?"
2.  **Deaf Gain:** Read texts by Deaf authors.
3.  **Rewrite:** Rewrite stories from a Deaf perspective.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Identifies bias; expresses pride in Deaf identity; questions texts.
