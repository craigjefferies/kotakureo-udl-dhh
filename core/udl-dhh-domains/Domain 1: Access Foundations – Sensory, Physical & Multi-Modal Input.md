# Domain 1: Access Foundations – Sensory, Physical & Multi-Modal Input

**Non-negotiables**
- **One visual source:** Never talk/sign while students read, watch, or write.
- **Captions always:** No exceptions. If failed, provide transcript/summary immediately.
- **Noise budget:** Manage background noise; warn before loud activities.
- **Sightlines:** Student sees teacher, interpreter, and board without twisting.
- **Pausing:** Stop → Get Eyes → Deliver Language.
- **No SimCom:** Don't speak and sign simultaneously if grammar degrades.

**Triage flow**
1. **Clear Channel:** Quiet, lit, safe space? (Domain 1A)
2. **Structure Signal:** Input separated into visual/linguistic chunks? (Domain 1B)
3. **Check Receiver:** Student fatigued/overloaded?
4. **Teach:** Proceed only when 1-3 are green.

## Subdomain 1A: The Whare (Sensory & Physical Environment)

### Strategy Node: Fatigue Management & Acoustic Triage

<metadata>
id: dom_1a_fatigue
title: Fatigue Management & Acoustic Triage
subdomain: 1A
trigger_signs: ["rubbing eyes", "head on desk", "zoning out", "afternoon outbursts", "withdrawal"]
do_now_2min: Move student away from hums. 2-min "silence break".
build_20min: Map timetable. Heavy listening in AM. Schedule "brain breaks".
success_looks_like: Attention maintained in PM; fewer behavioral spikes.
common_failure_mode: Ignoring "zoning out" as laziness vs exhaustion.
admin_enabler: Flexible timetabling (core subjects AM).
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
DHH students burn energy decoding incomplete audio/lipreading. "Listening fatigue" mimics disengagement but is physiological.

**High-Leverage Practice: Fatigue-First Design**
1. **Front-Load:** New/complex input in morning.
2. **Micro-Breaks:** 2-min break every 20 mins.
3. **Visual Offloading:** Written instructions to reduce listening load.
4. **Exit Pass:** Signal for "2 minutes outside."

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* Responsible exit pass use; regulated in Period 5.
- *Failure:* Pushing through "tiredness" leads to meltdown/shutdown.

**Age/Stage Variations**
- **Primary:** "Quiet Corner" (tent/beanbag).
- **Secondary:** Negotiated "Headphones On" time.

### Strategy Node: Visual Attention & Focus Anchors

<metadata>
id: dom_1a_visual_attention
title: Visual Attention & Focus Anchors
subdomain: 1A
trigger_signs: ["looking around wildly", "copying peers late", "missed instructions", "anxious scanning"]
do_now_2min: Point to exact spot with stick/pointer.
build_20min: "Visual Agenda" on whiteboard with ticked steps.
success_looks_like: Student tracks active speaker/source immediately.
common_failure_mode: Speaking while student searches for page/resource.
admin_enabler: Laser pointers/whiteboard space.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
DHH students can't "listen with one ear" while looking elsewhere. Missing the visual target means missing the message.

**High-Leverage Practice: One-Focus-At-A-Time**
1. **Anchor:** Point to target (board, object, person).
2. **Pause:** Wait for eyes.
3. **Explain:** Deliver content ONLY when eyes fixed.
4. **Switch:** Stop talking before pointing to new target.

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* Smooth gaze-switching; immediate task start.
- *Failure:* Constant room scanning to check peers.

### Strategy Node: Physical Space & Safety Positioning

<metadata>
id: dom_1a_physical_space
title: Safe Seating & Line-of-Sight Planning
subdomain: 1A
trigger_signs: ["twisting in chair", "standing up to see", "moving furniture", "startled by people"]
do_now_2min: Sit in student's chair to check sightlines.
build_20min: U-shape/semi-circle desks for peer sightlines.
success_looks_like: Static, clear view of all sources without moving.
common_failure_mode: Front seating with back to class (misses peers).
admin_enabler: Cap class sizes for U-shape arrangements.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Rows block peer/interpreter sightlines. Blocked vision = zero access.

**High-Leverage Practice: The Golden Triangle**
1. **Triangle Setup:** Teacher, Interpreter, Student form triangle.
2. **Back to Wall:** Minimize visual distractions behind speaker.
3. **Light Source:** On speaker's face, not behind (silhouetting).
4. **Visual Alarms:** Visual triggers for drills (lights/cards).

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* Participation in discussions; sees who is talking.
- *Failure:* Ignores peers; looks only at teacher.

### Strategy Node: Sensory Load & Noise Management

<metadata>
id: dom_1a_noise
title: Sensory Load Tuning
subdomain: 1A
trigger_signs: ["hands over ears", "turning off hearing aids", "headache complaints", "startled"]
do_now_2min: Close windows/doors. Off background music.
build_20min: Install "hush" materials (tennis balls, felt pads).
success_looks_like: Devices kept on; participation without distress.
common_failure_mode: "Background music" destroys signal-to-noise ratio.
admin_enabler: Fund acoustic treatments.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Aids/CIs amplify everything. Noise masks speech. Sudden loud noises can be painful.

**High-Leverage Practice: The Noise Budget**
1. **Audit:** Eliminate constant hums.
2. **Traffic Lights:** Visual noise meter.
3. **Predictability:** Warn before loud noises.
4. **Zones:** "Quiet zone" for independent work.

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* Self-regulation to quiet zones; asks peers to quieten.
- *Failure:* Removes equipment; agitated in groups.

### Strategy Node: Transition & Movement Routines

<metadata>
id: dom_1a_transitions
title: Calm Transitions & Visual Routines
subdomain: 1A
trigger_signs: ["wandering", "asking 'what do I do?'", "following peers blindly"]
do_now_2min: Visual signal before instructions.
build_20min: Teach "Stop-Look-Listen" routine.
success_looks_like: Stops, looks, gets instruction before moving.
common_failure_mode: Shouting instructions during movement.
admin_enabler: Visual alert systems in tech/science.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Auditory instructions during movement are lost. Transitions cause anxiety/disorientation.

**High-Leverage Practice: Stop–See–Shift**
1. **Freeze:** Visual signal to stop movement.
2. **Lock Eyes:** Wait for silence/attention.
3. **Instruct:** Short, clear instruction.
4. **Release:** Signal movement start.

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* Purposeful move to next task.
- *Failure:* Lost, waits for peers, copies.

## Subdomain 1B: Dual Coding (Multi-Modal Instruction)

### Strategy Node: Anti-SimCom & Modality Separation

<metadata>
id: dom_1b_antisimcom
title: Anti-SimCom & Clear Modality Phases

do_now_2min: Separate actions: Show slide. PAUSE. Talk.
build_20min: Record 5 mins. Reduce talking while pointing/writing by 50%.
success_looks_like: Time to process visual before audio.
common_failure_mode: SimCom - talking and signing poorly simultaneously.
admin_enabler: PLD on "Deaf-friendly delivery".
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Brain can't process complex visual/audio simultaneously. Split attention = overload/missed info.

**High-Leverage Practice: Look – Language – Link**
1. **Look:** Show visual. Say nothing.
2. **Language:** Face class. Explain (Speech/Sign).
3. **Link:** Point back to connect label to concept.
4. **Repeat:** Cycle distinctively.

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* Looking at right place at right time.
- *Failure:* Talking while writing on board.

title: Concept Maps & Visual-Linguistic Pairing
subdomain: 1B
trigger_signs: ["vocabulary gaps", "rote learning", "blank faces on abstract terms"]
do_now_2min: Google icon/image for key concept. Put on slide.
build_20min: Create/print "Concept Skeleton" (mind map).
success_looks_like: Points to image to explain concept.
common_failure_mode: Verbal-only definitions of abstract concepts.
admin_enabler: Visual symbol library subscriptions.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Abstract words hard to lipread/remember without visual hook. Verbal-only relies on damaged auditory channel.

**High-Leverage Practice: Concept Skeletons**
1. **Visual Anchor:** Icon/image for key terms.
2. **Spatial Layout:** Mind maps/flowcharts, not just lists.
3. **Permanent Display:** Core map visible.
4. **Retrieval:** Draw map to check understanding.

**Evidence Guide**

### Strategy Node: Visual Pausing & Pacing

<metadata>
id: dom_1b_visual_pacing
title: Visual Pausing & Processing Time
subdomain: 1B
trigger_signs: ["slow to answer", "interpreter still signing", "passive in Q&A"]
do_now_2min: Count to 5 slowly after every question.
build_20min: "Think-Pair-Share" for major questions.
success_looks_like: Raises hand; interpreter finishes before move on.
common_failure_mode: Rapid-fire Q&A favoring hearing students.
admin_enabler: None.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Interpreting lag + lipreading effort = DHH student 10s behind.

**High-Leverage Practice: The 5-Second Rule**
1. **Ask:** Pose question.
2. **Wait:** Count to 5.
3. **Check:** Ensure interpreter finished.
4. **Select:** Pick student.

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* Equal opportunity to answer.
- *Failure:* Teacher answers own question.

### Strategy Node: Multi-Modal Note Support

<metadata>
id: dom_1b_multimodal_notes
title: Visual Notes & Captions Support
subdomain: 1B
trigger_signs: ["messy notes", "gaps in work", "writing while teacher talks"]
do_now_2min: Provide printed slides/notes.
build_20min: Create "Cloze" notes (fill-in-blanks).
success_looks_like: Listens/watches during instruction, writes during work time.
common_failure_mode: Expecting note-taking during video/demo.
admin_enabler: Printing budget for support materials.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Can't write and lipread/watch sign simultaneously. Note-taking during instruction is impossible.

**High-Leverage Practice: Notes as Scaffold**
1. **Pre-Supply:** Slides/notes *before* lesson.
2. **Cloze:** Fill-in-blanks to reduce writing load.
3. **Scribe:** Peer/TA takes notes.
4. **Captions:** ALL videos captioned.

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* Complete notes without missing content.
- *Failure:* Choosing between learning and recording.

do_now_2min: Ask: "Is this working? What would help?"
build_20min: 15-min "Access Conference" for 3 supports.
success_looks_like: Advocates for needs.
common_failure_mode: Teacher decides "best" without consulting.
admin_enabler: Release time for 1:1 meetings.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Imposed supports feel stigmatizing. Students know needs but lack agency.

**High-Leverage Practice: The Access Interview**
1. **Ask:** "Where to sit?" "What helps?"
2. **Agree:** 3 "Rules of Engagement" (e.g., Captions, Front row).
3. **Review:** Check every term.
4. **Empower:** Encourage student reminders.

**Evidence Guide**
