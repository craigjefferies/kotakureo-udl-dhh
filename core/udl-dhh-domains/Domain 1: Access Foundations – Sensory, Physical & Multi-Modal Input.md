 are going to be used as # Domain 1: Access Foundations – Sensory, Physical & Multi-Modal Input

**Context:**  
This domain establishes the **non-negotiable baseline** for DHH learning. It combines the **Environmental Layer** (Physical & Sensory Access) with the **Instructional Input Layer** (Multi-Modal Design).

The core logic is simple:
> If the environment is toxic (noisy, visually chaotic, unsafe) OR the input is unstructured (simultaneous communication overload), **no amount of quality teaching will land.**

We must first **clear the channel** (Domain 1A) and then **structure the signal** (Domain 1B).

## Subdomain 1A: The Whare (Sensory & Physical Environment)
*Focus: Preventing overload, managing fatigue, and ensuring safety.*

### Strategy Node: Managing Listening Fatigue

<metadata>
id: dom_b_fatigue
name: Fatigue Management & Acoustic Triage
type: environmental_setup
target_constraint: ["auditory_fatigue", "behavioral_outbursts", "cognitive_exhaustion", "withdrawal"]
triggers: ["tired", "rubbing eyes", "headache", "zoning out", "acting out in afternoon", "grumpy", "switched off"]
complexity: low
time_required: continuous_policy
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
DHH students experience **listening fatigue** rapidly due to the cognitive load of decoding incomplete auditory input and lipreading. This often looks like "behavioral" issues or sudden withdrawal.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Fatigue-First Timetabling & Micro-Breaks"**
1.  **Timetable Design:** Schedule language-heavy tasks earlier; hands-on tasks later.
2.  **Micro-Breaks:** Every 15–20 mins, a 2-minute "brain break" (no new language input).
3.  **Acoustic Triage:** Seat student away from noise sources (fans, heaters) and close to visual focus.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student maintains visual tracking near end of lessons; outbursts reduce.
*   *Failure:* Student "switches off" or acts out mid-lesson; teacher ignores fatigue signs.

**Age/Stage Variations:**
*   **Primary (Y0-6):** "Quiet Corner" (beanbag/tent) with a visual "battery low" card they can place on their desk.
*   **Secondary (Y7-13):** "Exit Pass" or agreed non-verbal signal to step out for 2 mins. Negotiated "Headphones On" time for independent work.

### Strategy Node: Visual Attention Management

<metadata>
id: dom_b_visual_attention
name: Visual Attention & Focus Anchors
type: environmental_setup
target_constraint: ["visual_overload", "missed_instructions", "constant_re-orientation"]
triggers: ["looking around", "distracted", "missed instructions", "doesn't know what to do", "watching friends", "scanning room"]
complexity: low
time_required: continuous_policy
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Competing visual stimuli (teacher, interpreter, slides, peers) split attention. DHH students cannot watch two things at once.

**High-Leverage Practice: "One-Focus-At-A-Time"**
1.  **One Focus Source:** Only one active visual source at a time (e.g., stop signing to show a video).
2.  **Visual Anchors:** Use fixed visual cues (numbered steps, icons) on the board.
3.  **Cue Before View:** "Look at this picture" -> Pause -> Explain.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student tracks correct speaker; follows multi-step instructions.
*   *Failure:* Student scans wildly between sources; instructions given while student is looking away.

**Age/Stage Variations:**
*   **Primary (Y0-6):** "Mat Spots" (tape on floor) to define where to look. Teacher uses a puppet or wand to direct gaze.
*   **Secondary (Y7-13):** Laser pointer on whiteboard. Explicit "Look here" verbal cues. Numbered agenda on board to track progress.

### Strategy Node: Physical Space & Safety Positioning

<metadata>
id: dom_b_physical_space
name: Safe Seating & Line-of-Sight Planning
type: environmental_setup
target_constraint: ["blocked_line_of_sight", "unsafe_movement_patterns", "missed_visual_information"]
triggers: ["can't see", "turning around", "moving chair", "safety concerns", "fire drill issues", "leaning"]
complexity: low
time_required: initial_setup_plus_monitoring
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Blocked sightlines prevent access to teacher/interpreter. In emergencies, auditory alarms may be missed.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Line-of-Sight Map"**
1.  **Audit:** Check sightlines from the student's chair (teacher, interpreter, board).
2.  **U-Shape Seating:** Enables peer-to-peer visual access.
3.  **Visual Safety:** Flashing lights or specific visual cues for alarms/drills.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student rarely needs to reposition to see; moves with peers during drills.
*   *Failure:* Student leans/twists to see; is delayed in emergency response.

### Strategy Node: Sensory Load & Noise Management

<metadata>
id: dom_b_noise
name: Sensory Load Tuning
type: environmental_setup
target_constraint: ["noise_sensitivity", "startle_response", "background_noise_interference"]
triggers: ["too loud", "hands over ears", "startled", "complains about noise", "hearing aid feedback", "noisy classroom"]
complexity: medium
time_required: initial_audit_plus_routines
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Background noise masks speech for hearing aid/CI users. Sudden noises cause startle/distress.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Noise Budget"**
1.  **Audit & Limit:** Identify noise sources; set "quiet zones".
2.  **Visual Noise Meter:** Use traffic light system for class volume (Green=Quiet, Red=Loud).
3.  **Predictability:** Warn before loud activities; allow ear defenders if needed.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student remains engaged during group work; requests breaks appropriately.
*   *Failure:* Student turns off devices frequently; startles easily.

**Age/Stage Variations:**
*   **Primary (Y0-6):** "Yacker Tracker" (traffic light noise meter). Tennis balls on chair legs.
*   **Secondary (Y7-13):** Negotiated "One Voice" rule during discussions. Use of text-based chat for group work to reduce acoustic load.

### Strategy Node: Transition & Movement Routines

<metadata>
id: dom_b_transitions
name: Calm Transitions & Visual Routines
type: environmental_setup
target_constraint: ["confusion_during_transitions", "lost_instructions_when_moving", "heightened_anxiety"]
triggers: ["lost during changeover", "wandering", "anxious when moving", "chaos", "doesn't line up", "running"]
complexity: low
time_required: routine_building
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Instructions given *during* movement are lost. Transitions are high-anxiety moments.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Stop–See–Shift"**
1.  **Stop:** Visual signal to freeze movement.
2.  **See:** Ensure eye contact.
3.  **Shift:** Give instruction (visually supported) *before* movement resumes.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Smooth transitions; student arrives at correct task/location with peers.
*   *Failure:* Teacher talks while class moves; student follows peers blindly.

## Subdomain 1B: Dual Coding (Multi-Modal Instruction)
*Focus: Optimally sequencing visual, signed, and written input.*

### Strategy Node: Anti-SimCom & Modality Separation

<metadata>
id: dom_c_antisimcom
name: Anti-SimCom & Clear Modality Phases
type: instructional_delivery
target_constraint: ["split_attention", "missed_grammar", "overload_when_teacher_talks_and_signs"]
triggers: ["confused by teacher", "teacher talks too fast", "can't follow", "overwhelmed", "simcom", "talking and signing"]
complexity: medium
time_required: planning_plus_in_class_habits
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
"Simultaneous Communication" (talking and signing at full speed) degrades both languages and splits attention.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Look – Language – Link"**
1.  **Look:** Show visual (slide/object). Pause.
2.  **Language:** Explain in NZSL/English (without pointing).
3.  **Link:** Point back to visual to connect concept.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student recalls concepts accurately; eyes focus steadily (not flicking).
*   *Failure:* Teacher talks/signs/clicks simultaneously; student looks overwhelmed.

### Strategy Node: Dual Coding of Concepts

<metadata>
id: dom_c_dualcoding
name: Concept Maps & Visual-Linguistic Pairing
type: instructional_delivery
target_constraint: ["abstract_concepts_not_sticking", "vague_comprehension", "difficulty_with_inferencing"]
triggers: ["doesn't understand concepts", "forgets quickly", "needs pictures", "abstract ideas hard", "vocabulary gap"]
complexity: medium
time_required: resource_preparation_plus_modelling
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Abstract concepts (e.g., "democracy") are hard to retain from verbal/signed explanations alone.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Concept Skeletons"**
1.  **Visual Structure:** Mind maps, flowcharts, timelines.
2.  **Labeling:** Pair NZSL sign + Written English + Icon.
3.  **Retrieval:** Have student reconstruct the map.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student explains concept using the map; generates own maps.
*   *Failure:* Concepts remain fuzzy; maps exist but aren't used for retrieval.

### Strategy Node: Visual Pausing & Pacing

<metadata>
id: dom_c_visual_pacing
name: Visual Pausing & Processing Time
type: instructional_delivery
target_constraint: ["processing_speed_mismatch", "late_responses", "missed_details"]
triggers: ["slow to answer", "blank stare", "interpreter behind", "teacher too fast", "needs more time"]
complexity: low
time_required: habit_building
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
DHH students need extra time to process visual/linguistic input. Rapid-fire teaching leaves them behind.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Wait 5, Then Check"**
1.  **Wait Time:** Count to 5 silently after asking a question.
2.  **Visual Countdown:** Use fingers or timer to normalize the pause.
3.  **Interpreter Lag:** Allow time for interpreter to finish before expecting response.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student initiates responses; answers are more thoughtful.
*   *Failure:* Teacher answers own questions; moves on while interpreter is still signing.

### Strategy Node: Multi-Modal Note Support

<metadata>
id: dom_c_multimodal_notes
name: Visual Notes & Captions Support
type: instructional_delivery
target_constraint: ["note_taking_overload", "missed_captions", "cannot_listen_and_write"]
triggers: ["can't write and listen", "messy notes", "gaps in notes", "missed video content", "no captions"]
complexity: medium
time_required: resource_preparation
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Impossible to watch interpreter/teacher and write notes simultaneously.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Notes as Scaffold"**
1.  **Cloze Notes:** Fill-in-the-blanks, pre-drawn diagrams.
2.  **Visual Capture:** Allow photos of board; provide slides in advance.
3.  **Captions:** Use captions for video; highlight key terms.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Notes are complete/organized; student spends time watching instruction.
*   *Failure:* Notes are sparse/messy; student misses instruction while writing.

### Strategy Node: Co-Designing Access Plans

<metadata>
id: dom_c_codesign_access
name: Student-Teacher Access Plan
type: instructional_design
target_constraint: ["misaligned_supports", "one_size_fits_all_solutions", "student_not_owning_their_support"]
triggers: ["refuses help", "doesn't use aids", "passive", "teacher guessing needs", "doesn't like FM"]
complexity: medium
time_required: 1–2_conferences_plus_updates
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Supports are often decided *for* students, leading to mismatch and low buy-in.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Access Interviews"**
1.  **Ask:** "What helps you learn? What makes it hard?"
2.  **Agree:** Co-create a visual plan (e.g., "I need captions," "I need front seating").
3.  **Review:** Check in termly.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student explains their access needs; teacher adjusts based on plan.
*   *Failure:* Student unaware of supports; teacher assumes "one size fits all".
