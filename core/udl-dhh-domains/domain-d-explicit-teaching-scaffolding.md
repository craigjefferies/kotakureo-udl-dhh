# Domain D: Explicit Teaching & Scaffolding (The "How")

**Context:** These strategy nodes define the "Pedagogical Layer." They align with the *Common Practice Model (CPM)* and focus on making the internal thinking process visible and tangible for DHH learners.

## Strategy Node: The Gradual Release (I Do-We Do-You Do)

<metadata>
id: dom_d_gradual_release
name: Explicit Modeling & Scaffolding
type: instructional_framework
target_constraint: ["learned_helplessness", "task_paralysis", "mimicry_without_understanding"]
complexity: high
time_required: full_lesson_structure
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
DHH students often miss the "incidental" instructions given while papers are being handed out. If we jump straight to "You Do," they freeze. We must provide a static visual reference of the *process*, not just the final product.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Script)**
    * **Written Transcript:** Teacher provides a printed step-by-step handout of the model *while* demonstrating.
    * **Syntax Box:** Teacher draws a box on the board labeled "Sentence Starters" containing the exact academic language needed for the task.
    * Teacher thinks aloud: *"I am choosing this word because..."*
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do - The Manipulation)**
    * **Structure Strips:** Teacher provides cut-up sentence parts (magnetic or paper).
    * Class works together to physically arrange them into the correct order.
    * Teacher asks: *"If I move this word here, does it still make sense?"*
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * Student uses the "Syntax Box" to write their own sentences.
    * Student refers to the "Written Transcript" if stuck, rather than waiting for the teacher.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * The "I Do" model stays visible on the board during independent work.
    * Students are physically manipulating words/symbols during the "We Do" phase.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * **"Guess what's in my head":** Asking students to guess the answer instead of modeling it first.
    * Erasing the model before the students start working.
    * Providing a finished example without showing the *steps* to create it.

## Strategy Node: Examples vs. Non-Examples (Boundary Testing)

<metadata>
id: dom_d_examples
name: Concept Definition (Examples vs. Non-Examples)
type: concept_formation
target_constraint: ["overgeneralization", "fuzzy_concepts", "vocabulary_misuse"]
complexity: medium
time_required: 15_mins
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
Definitions are abstract text. To truly understand a concept (e.g., "Mammal"), DHH students need to see the *boundaries* of the rule. Showing what it is *NOT* is as important as showing what it *IS*.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do)**
    * **T-Chart:** Teacher draws a T-Chart: "Example (Yes)" vs "Non-Example (No)".
    * Teacher places an image (e.g., Dog) in "Yes" and signs *why* (Has fur, live birth).
    * Teacher places an image (e.g., Fish) in "No" and signs *why* (Has scales, eggs).
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do)**
    * **"Sort the Rules":** Teacher holds up a card (e.g., Whale).
    * Students discuss: *"It lives in water, BUT it has live birth."*
    * Student places it in the "Yes" column physically.
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * **Correction Mark Focus:** Teacher circles a specific error in green on student work.
    * Student must identify *why* it is a non-example and correct it.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * The "Non-Example" column is explicitly used to define the rule.
    * Visuals are sorted physically.
    * Teacher highlights specific features (e.g., circling the scales on the fish) to prove the classification.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Only showing correct examples (leads to false assumptions).
    * Using ambiguous examples that confuse the rule early on.

## Strategy Node: Error Analysis & Concept Linking

<metadata>
id: dom_d_error_analysis
name: Deep Understanding & Relationships
type: assessment_strategy
target_constraint: ["rote_memorization", "surface_level_learning", "inability_to_transfer"]
complexity: high
time_required: 10_mins
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
DHH students often memorize "facts" without understanding the *relationships* between them. Asking them to "Spot the Error" or "Link the Concepts" forces them to use their internal logic, moving beyond simple recall.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do)**
    * **"Spot the Error":** Teacher presents a math problem with *one deliberate mistake* on the board.
    * Teacher acts confused: *"Wait, $5 \times 5$ isn't 10. That's addition. It should be 25."*
    * Teacher circles the error in red and corrects it.
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do)**
    * **"The Missing Link":** Teacher draws [Sun] $\to$ [  ?  ] $\to$ [Plant].
    * Teacher asks: *"What is the invisible arrow? What is the verb?"*
    * Class agrees on the sign/word "Energy/Light" to fill the gap.
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * Students are given a diagram with 3 errors. They must circle and fix them.
    * **Digital Poll:** Students answer a quick "Why is this wrong?" multiple-choice question on their device.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Teacher praises the *identification of the error*, not just the right answer.
    * Students are asked to "Sign the Verb" (the relationship), not just the nouns.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Teacher corrects errors for the student immediately.
    * Focus is only on getting the "right answer" rather than analyzing the process.

## Strategy Node: Critical Inquiry (HOTS)

<metadata>
id: dom_d_hots
name: Higher-Order Thinking (The "Evidence Check")
type: questioning_technique
target_constraint: ["passive_learning", "lack_of_justification", "simple_recall_bias"]
complexity: high
time_required: continuous_habit
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
It is easy to let DHH students stay at the "Remember/Understand" level. We must push them to "Analyze/Evaluate." The mechanism for this is demanding *evidence* for every claim.

### Implementation Spec (Routine Integration)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do)**
    * Teacher makes a claim: *"The character is sad."*
    * Teacher asks self: *"How do I know?"*
    * Teacher highlights the text: *"Tears rolled down."* -> *"This is my evidence."*
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do)**
    * **The "Why" Routine:** Teacher asks a question. Student answers.
    * Teacher creates a visual "Stop" hand: *"Evidence?"* or *"How do you know?"*
    * Student must point to the text/diagram before the answer is accepted.
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * Students use a **Sentence Stem**: *"I know this because [Evidence]..."* in their written work.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * "How do you know?" is asked more often than "What is the answer?".
    * Students physically point to evidence in the text.
    * Sentence stems for justification are visible on the wall.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Accepting one-word answers without justification.
    * Teacher explains the "Why" instead of making the student find it.
