# Domain E: Mana Motuhake & Agency (Self-Regulation)

**Context:** These strategy nodes define the "Action & Expression" layer. They focus on moving the ākonga from a passive recipient of support to an active driver of their own access and learning.

## Strategy Node: Explicit Self-Advocacy (The "Repair" Kit)

<metadata>
id: dom_e_advocacy
name: Communication Repair & Equipment Ownership
type: behavioral_intervention
target_constraint: ["learned_helplessness", "passive_withdrawal", "social_anxiety", "equipment_refusal"]
complexity: medium
time_required: continuous_habit
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
DHH students often default to the path of least resistance (smiling/nodding) when communication breaks down. We must script and automate the "Repair Strategies" so the social cost of interrupting the lesson is zero.

### Implementation Spec (System -> Routine -> Autonomy)
* **Phase 1: Teacher Setup (System Design)**
    * **The Repair Menu:** Teacher tapes a permanent card to the desk with 3 options:
        1.  "Please Repeat" (I didn't hear).
        2.  "Please Rephrase" (I didn't understand the words).
        3.  "I missed the start" (Context gap).
* **Phase 2: The Training (Role Play)**
    * **The "Mumble Game":** Teacher intentionally mumbles or turns away during a low-stakes chat.
    * Student is rewarded/praised specifically for *stopping* the teacher and pointing to the Repair Card.
* **Phase 3: Student Autonomy (Live Use)**
    * **Mic Ownership:** The student manages the pass-around microphone. *They* hand it to the peer who wants to speak, enforcing the "No Mic, No Talk" rule themselves.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Student points to the desk card instead of raising a hand helplessly.
    * Teacher stops immediately when signaled, validating the interruption.
    * Student physically holds/tracks the microphone.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Teacher asks "Did you hear that?" (Yes/No trap).
    * Student looks at teacher aide for help instead of the speaker.
    * Teacher controls the mic passing (robbing agency).

## Strategy Node: Simultaneous Response (Participation)

<metadata>
id: dom_e_response_cards
name: Simultaneous Response Systems (Pinch Cards)
type: formative_assessment
target_constraint: ["slow_processing_speed", "fear_of_failure", "copying_peers"]
complexity: low
time_required: preparation_needed
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
In a verbal Q&A ("Who knows the answer?"), the fastest auditory processor wins. DHH students are always seconds behind. Simultaneous responses (everyone shows at once) level the playing field and force every student to commit to an answer.

### Implementation Spec (Setup -> Practice -> Routine)
* **Phase 1: The Tool (Setup)**
    * **Pinch Cards:** Teacher provides a card with A/B/C/D or True/False on the edges.
    * **Mini-Whiteboards:** Every student has a board and marker.
* **Phase 2: The Protocol (Guided Practice)**
    * Teacher asks question.
    * Teacher gives **"Think Time"** (3-5 seconds).
    * Teacher signals: **"3, 2, 1, Show Me."**
    * Students hold cards/boards against their chest (private) or up high (public).
* **Phase 3: The Discrimination (Routine)**
    * **Concept Cards:** Student has a "Noun" card and a "Verb" card. Teacher signs a word; student holds up the matching category.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * 100% of class responds.
    * Teacher waits for the DHH student to look up before counting down "3, 2, 1."
    * DHH student answers independently (not looking at neighbor's card).
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * **"Hands Up":** Calling on the first hand raised (ignores the DHH latency).
    * Accepting a verbal shout-out while others are writing.

## Strategy Node: Overt Active Responding (The Evidence Check)

<metadata>
id: dom_e_overt_response
name: "Show Me" & Structured Notes
type: engagement_strategy
target_constraint: ["survival_nod", "masked_confusion", "passive_listening"]
complexity: medium
time_required: continuous_habit
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
DHH students can "fake" listening perfectly. To ensure cognitive engagement, we must require *Overt Physical Actions* (pointing, writing, sorting) that cannot be faked.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do)**
    * **"Show Me the Evidence":** Teacher models an answer. *"I think he is happy."*
    * Teacher physically puts a finger on the word "smiled" in the text. *"My finger is on the proof."*
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do)**
    * **Visible Partner Check:** Pairs discuss an answer.
    * Rule: You cannot speak/sign your answer until you **point** to the evidence on the page. Partner checks the finger placement.
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * **Structured Notes:** Student fills in a "Cloze" (fill-in-the-blank) activity or graphic organizer *during* the lecture, ensuring active translation of sign/speech to text.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Student's finger is physically on the text during discussion.
    * Notes are being filled in real-time, not copied at the end.
    * "No pointing, no answer" rule is enforced.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Accepting "I remember it" as evidence.
    * Allowing the DHH student to sit passively without a pen/finger moving.

## Strategy Node: Visual Feedback & Data (Mana Motuhake)

<metadata>
id: dom_e_visual_feedback
name: Visual Goals & Self-Graphing
type: metacognitive_strategy
target_constraint: ["low_self_efficacy", "fixed_mindset", "ambiguous_expectations"]
complexity: medium
time_required: 5_mins_weekly
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
Verbal praise ("Good job!") is fleeting and often missed by DHH students. Visual feedback is permanent. When students track their own data (Self-Graphing), they see the link between effort and growth, building Mana Motuhake.

### Implementation Spec (Setup -> Routine -> Reflection)
* **Phase 1: Setup (The Tools)**
    * **Next Goal Card:** A small card taped to the desk with *one* specific target (e.g., "Use full stops").
    * **Fluency Chart:** A bar graph in the back of the book for tracking scores (Maths facts, Spelling, Reading speed).
* **Phase 2: Routine (The Input)**
    * **Feedback Ratio:** Teacher gives 3 positive written comments for every 1 correction.
    * **Self-Graphing:** After a quiz, the *student* (not teacher) colours in the bar on their graph to show the new score.
* **Phase 3: Reflection (The Analysis)**
    * Teacher asks: *"Look at your graph. Is the line going up? Why?"*
    * Student identifies the strategy that worked.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Goal Card is visible on the desk during work.
    * Student can explain their own graph ("I got better because I studied").
    * Feedback is written/drawn, not just spoken.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * **General Praise:** "Good work" written without specifying *what* was good.
    * Teacher keeps the data/grades private (student doesn't own the progress).
