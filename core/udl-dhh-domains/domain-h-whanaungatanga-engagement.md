# Domain H: Whanaungatanga & Engagement (Identity & Culture)

**Context:** These strategy nodes define the "Relational Foundation." They align with *Te Mātaiaho* (NZ Curriculum) principles. These are specific **protocols** to ensure the student feels culturally safe and "seen."

## Strategy Node: Whanaungatanga (Relational Safety Protocols)

<metadata>
id: dom_h_whanaungatanga
name: Relationships First (Pepeha & Mood Meters)
type: cultural_foundation
target_constraint: ["social_isolation", "teacher_student_disconnect", "high_cortisol_stress"]
complexity: low
time_required: 2_mins_daily
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
If a student feels like a "guest" in the classroom, their brain stays in threat mode. We use visual structures to make belonging tangible, not just a feeling.

### Implementation Spec (Model -> Normalise -> Own)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Visual Pepeha)**
    * **Visual Pepeha:** Teacher creates a **Visual Map** (Drawings/Photos) of their mountain, river, and family. It is displayed on the wall, not just spoken.

    * **Name Sign Protocol:** Teacher asks the RTD (Resource Teacher Deaf) or Whānau for the student's name sign. *Rule:* Never invent a nickname; ask for the taonga.
* **Phase 2: Shared Practice (We Do - The Mood Meter)**
    * **The Velcro Check-In:** Use a "Mood Meter" chart (Energy vs. Pleasantness).
    * **Routine:** As students enter, they move their magnet/photo to their current emotion.
    * **The Norm:** Teacher explicitly acknowledges the DHH student's status: *"I see you are in the Blue Zone (Tired). That is okay."* 
* **Phase 3: Student Ownership (You Do - The Space)**
    * **Desk Claim:** Student creates a "Desk Mat" with photos of their interests/culture to physically claim territory in the room.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * The Visual Pepeha is permanently visible.
    * The Check-In happens *before* the first instruction.
    * Teacher uses the Name Sign (or correct NZSL attention wave) every time.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Skipping the check-in to "save time."
    * Inventing a sign name because the real one is "too hard."

## Strategy Node: Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy (Deaf Gain)

<metadata>
id: dom_h_deafhood
name: Deaf Gain & NZSL Visibility
type: identity_work
target_constraint: ["deficit_mindset", "cultural_shame", "audism"]
complexity: medium
time_required: weekly_spotlight
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
We must actively flip the script from "Hearing Loss" (Deficit) to "Deaf Gain" (Asset). We do this by treating NZSL as a prestige language and Deafness as an expert lens.

### Implementation Spec (Model -> Normalise -> Own)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Expert Lens)**
    * **The "Silent Start":** Teacher starts a lesson with 5 minutes of **Zero Voice** (NZSL/Gesture only). This frames visual communication as the "norm" and auditory as "optional."
    * **Deaf Role Models:** Teacher spotlights a Deaf expert relevant to the unit (e.g., *"This week's scientist is [Name], who is Deaf..."*).
* **Phase 2: Shared Practice (We Do - Functional Sign)**
    * **Sign of the Week:** Class learns ONE high-frequency sign (e.g., "Finish," "Toilet," "Help").
    * **The Rule:** You *must* sign it to get the pass/help. Verbal asking is redirected: *"Use your hands."*
* **Phase 3: Student Ownership (You Do - The Consultant)**
    * **The Vibration Lab:** When learning sound/physics, the DHH student is invited to lead the station on "Feeling Sound" (Tactile experience), positioning them as the sensory expert.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Hearing students use "Toilet/Drink" signs silently.
    * The "Silent Start" is treated as a serious activity, not a game.
    * Deaf adults/figures are mentioned in the curriculum, not just in "Deaf Awareness Week."
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * "SimCom" (Signing and speaking badly at the same time).
    * Using the DHH student as a "Circus Pony" (*"Show us how to sign X!"*) without prior consent.

## Strategy Node: Co-Design & Feedback (The Feedback Loop)

<metadata>
id: dom_h_codesign
name: Access Checks & The "Orange Card"
type: feedback_loop
target_constraint: ["passive_compliance", "masked_struggle", "resentment"]
complexity: high
time_required: end_of_lesson
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
Teachers often assume access is happening. We need hard data. We replace "Did you hear?" (which gets a fake nod) with a concrete rating system.

### Implementation Spec (Model -> Normalise -> Own)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Fist-to-Five)**
    * **The Vote:** At the end of instruction, Teacher asks: *"Access Check. Fist (0) to Five. How clear was I?"*
    * **The Reaction:** Teacher publicly adjusts: *"Okay, I see a '3'. I was speaking too fast. I will slow down."*
* **Phase 2: Shared Practice (We Do - The Safe Break)**
    * **The Orange Card:** Place a physical Orange Card on the student's desk.
    * **The Protocol:** If the student flips it over, they get 5 minutes of "Visual Silence" (no eye contact required) to reboot their brain. No questions asked.
* **Phase 3: Student Ownership (You Do - The Medium)**
    * **Output Menu:** For assessment, the student circles their choice: [Written Essay] OR [Signed Video] OR [Visual Slide Deck].
    * **Self-Report:** Student writes/signs a weekly "Access Report": *"This week, the videos were hard because..."*

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Teacher acts on the "Fist-to-Five" data immediately.
    * The "Orange Card" is respected (teacher doesn't nag the student during the break).
    * Student submits work in NZSL/Video format.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Asking "Do you understand?" (The worst question).
    * Treating the "Safe Break" as "Avoiding Work."
    * Ignoring low access ratings.
