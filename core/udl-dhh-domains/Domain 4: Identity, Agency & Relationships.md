# Domain 4: Identity, Agency & Relationships

**Non-negotiables**
- **Nothing About Me Without Me:** Student present/prepared for every IEP.
- **Access is a Right:** No "asking nicely" for basic access.
- **Identity is Safety:** Positive Deaf identity buffers isolation.
- **Relationships First:** Safety precedes learning.
- **Stop-Name-Ask:** Scripted repair for communication breakdowns.
- **Future Focused:** Goals link to "Who do I want to be?".

**Triage flow**
1. **Safety:** Is student isolated/bullied? (Immediate action).
2. **Agency:** Can student explain their access needs?
3. **Connection:** Has at least one genuine friend?
4. **Identity:** Views self as "broken" or "Deaf/Hard of Hearing"?

## Bridge Note: Language as Emotional & Identity Safety

Precise, accessible language is a wellbeing intervention.
- **Language reduces frustration:** clearer meaning → fewer breakdowns.
- **First-language strength protects:** strong NZSL supports confidence and belonging.
- **Emotion vocabulary enables regulation:** learners can name feelings and needs, not act them out.

**Guardrails**
- Don’t mislabel language confusion as “behaviour”.
- Don’t underestimate language deprivation impacts on wellbeing.

See also: Domain 2 (Chaining, fingerspelling, metalinguistic teaching) for the language tools that make this possible.

## Subdomain 4A: Mana Motuhake (Identity & Agency)

### Strategy Node: Personal Learning Profile ("User Manual")

<metadata>
id: dom_4a_profile
title: My Learning Profile / User Manual
subdomain: 4A
trigger_signs: ["doesn't know needs", "passive", "teacher decides everything", "new teacher issues"]
do_now_2min: Print 1-page template. Ask: "What helps you learn?"
build_20min: Create digital "Access Card" for phone to show new teachers.
success_looks_like: Student presents profile to new teacher/reliever.
common_failure_mode: Profile sits in a drawer unused.
admin_enabler: Mandate "Learner Profiles" for priority learners.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Students cannot articulate needs; professionals hold knowledge. Access fails when teachers change.

**High-Leverage Practice: "My User Manual"**
1. **Co-Construct:** Create 1-page profile ("How I learn", "What helps", "What is hard").
2. **Empower:** Student owns the document/digital card.
3. **Use:** Student presents this to new teachers/relievers.

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* Student articulates needs; refers to profile.
- *Failure:* Student waits for teacher to "figure it out".

### Strategy Node: Explicit Self-Advocacy Routines

<metadata>
id: dom_4a_self_advocacy
title: Self-Advocacy Scripts & Routines
subdomain: 4A
trigger_signs: ["nods and smiles", "doesn't speak up", "pretends to understand", "compliance"]
do_now_2min: Teach "T-Sign" (Time out) or "Stop" hand signal.
build_20min: Roleplay "Stop-Name-Ask" scenarios until automatic.
success_looks_like: Student interrupts lesson to ask for clarification.
common_failure_mode: Telling them to "just ask" without teaching *how*.
admin_enabler: None.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
"Nodding/coping" masks access gaps. Fear of appearing "difficult" prevents asking.

Note: Fingerspelling can be a fast repair/advocacy move (“I can spell it / write it”); see Domain 2.

**High-Leverage Practice: "STOP–NAME–ASK"**
1. **Stop:** Signal to pause (Hand signal/T-sign).
2. **Name:** Identify issue ("I missed that", "Too fast").
3. **Ask:** Request repair ("Please repeat", "Write it down").

**Evidence Guide**
- *Success:* Student interrupts to repair communication.
- *Failure:* Student stays silent when lost.

### Strategy Node: Goal Setting & Self-Monitoring

<metadata>

do_now_2min: "What is ONE thing you want to get better at this week?"
build_20min: Weekly 5-min goal review with visual tracking.
success_looks_like: Student knows current goal and tracks progress.
common_failure_mode: Goals set *by* adults *for* students.
admin_enabler: None.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Goals are abstract and teacher-owned. Student compliance replaces ownership.

**High-Leverage Practice: "My Goal, My Plan"**
1. **I Will:** Student sets specific, observable goal.
2. **Visual Plan:** Track progress visually (ticks/stickers).
3. **Review:** Weekly check: "Did I meet my goal? Why/Why not?"

**Evidence Guide**

success_looks_like: Student expresses pride/neutrality about deafness.
common_failure_mode: Focusing only on "fixing" hearing loss.
admin_enabler: Funding for Deaf mentors/role models.
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Deficit narratives ("impairment") damage self-worth. Isolation breeds shame.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Deaf Gain"**
1. **Role Models:** Exposure to successful Deaf adults.
2. **Reframing:** "I can't hear" -> "The room is too noisy."
3. **Community:** Connect with Deaf peers/culture.

common_failure_mode: "Nothing about me without me" violated.
admin_enabler: Policy: Students must attend IEPs (age appropriate).
</metadata>

**Problem/Barrier**
Students discussed *about*, not *with*. Learned helplessness results from removed agency.

**High-Leverage Practice: "Student-Led Meetings"**
