# Domain 4: Identity, Agency & Relationships

**Context:**  
This domain focuses on the **learner as a person**. It recognizes that access and instruction are insufficient if the learner is passive, isolated, or disconnected.

The core logic:
> If decisions are made *for* the learner, they learn helplessness. If they are isolated, they lose motivation.
> We must build **Mana Motuhake** (Agency/Self) and **Whanaungatanga** (Connection/Others).

We combine **Identity & Agency** (Domain 4A) with **Relationships & Engagement** (Domain 4B).

---

## Subdomain 4A: Mana Motuhake (Identity & Agency)
*Focus: Knowing oneself, advocating for needs, and building a positive Deaf identity.*

### Strategy Node: Personal Learning Profile ("User Manual")

<metadata>
id: dom_e_profile
name: My Learning Profile / User Manual
type: student_identity_tool
target_constraint: ["low_self_knowledge", "cannot_explain_needs", "adult_dependency"]
triggers: ["doesn't know what they need", "passive", "teacher decides everything", "new teacher issues", "can't explain disability"]
complexity: medium
time_required: initial_build_plus_updates
</metadata>

**Problem / Access Barrier:**  
Students cannot explain their own needs. Professionals hold all the knowledge.

**High-Leverage Practice: "My User Manual"**
1.  **Co-Construct:** Student and teacher create a 1-page profile.
2.  **Content:** "How I learn best", "What helps me", "What is hard".
3.  **Use:** Student presents this to new teachers/relievers.

**Evidence Guide:**
*   *Success:* Student articulates needs; refers to profile.
*   *Failure:* Profile sits in a drawer; student passive in meetings.

**Age/Stage Variations:**
*   **Primary (Y0-6):** "All About Me" poster with photos. Co-created with whānau.
*   **Secondary (Y7-13):** Digital "Access Card" (PDF on phone) or slide deck. Student emails it to teachers themselves.
