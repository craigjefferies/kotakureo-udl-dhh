# Domain C: Multi-Modal Instruction (Dual Coding)

**Context:** These strategy nodes define the "Input Layer." They focus on how information enters the student's brain without causing "Split Attention" or "Cognitive Overload."

## Strategy Node: Separation of Modalities (The "Anti-SimCom" Protocol)

<metadata>
id: dom_c_modality
name: Separation of Modalities ("Show, Freeze, Tell")
type: instructional_habit
target_constraint: ["split_attention_effect", "linguistic_degradation", "visual_overload"]
complexity: medium
time_required: continuous_habit
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
The human brain cannot process complex visual input (diagram/text) and complex linguistic input (speech/sign) simultaneously without loss. For DHH students, "Simultaneous Communication" (SimCom) often results in poor English *and* poor Sign. Inputs must be sequential.

### Implementation Spec (System -> Routine -> Autonomy)
* **Phase 1: Teacher Habit (System)**
    * **"Show, Freeze, Tell":**
        1. Point to the image/text.
        2. **Freeze** your body (stop moving/talking) for 3-5 seconds to let them look.
        3. Turn to face the class and *then* explain it.
    * **The "Board Turn":** Never speak/sign while writing on the board. Write first, stop, turn, then speak.
* **Phase 2: Class Norm (Routine)**
    * **The "Modality Switch":** If using an interpreter, the teacher pauses after significant chunks to allow the interpreter to finish, ensuring the student isn't watching the interpreter while the teacher changes the slide.
* **Phase 3: Student Autonomy**
    * Student is empowered to signal "Hold" or "Too Fast" if the visual and the explanation overlap.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Teacher is silent/still while pointing to a diagram.
    * Teacher makes full eye contact with the class *before* starting the explanation.
    * Visuals are displayed *before* the verbal explanation begins.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * **Talking to the Board:** Teacher explains while writing (sound bounces away, lips hidden).
    * **The Laser Pointer Rambler:** Waving a laser pointer around while talking continuously.
    * **SimCom:** Trying to sign complex sentences while speaking (usually ruins the grammar of both).

## Strategy Node: Visual Orientation (Seek & Locate)

<metadata>
id: dom_c_orientation
name: Seek & Locate Time (The "3-Second Scan")
type: classroom_management
target_constraint: ["missing_peer_contributions", "social_exclusion", "auditory_latency"]
complexity: low
time_required: instant_delay
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
Hearing students can listen to a peer behind them without looking. DHH students must physically turn their bodies to access the comment. If the peer starts talking immediately, the DHH student misses the first sentence (the context).

### Implementation Spec (System -> Routine -> Autonomy)
* **Phase 1: Teacher Habit (System)**
    * **The "3-Second Scan":** When calling on a student:
        1. Say the name.
        2. Hold hand up/Wait.
        3. **Count to 3** visually.
        4. *Then* allow them to answer.
* **Phase 2: Class Norm (Routine)**
    * **"Hands Down" Listen:** Rule: "When someone is speaking, all other hands go down." (Visual noise from waving hands distracts the eyes from finding the speaker).
* **Phase 3: Student Autonomy**
    * DHH student physically turns/moves chair to track the active speaker.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * There is a distinct silence between calling a name and the answer.
    * Teacher points to the student who is about to speak to aid location.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * **Ping-Ponging:** Rapid-fire questioning where speakers change too fast for visual tracking.
    * allowing students to shout out answers without being identified first.

## Strategy Node: Chunking & Visual Pausing

<metadata>
id: dom_c_chunking
name: Information Chunking & Sequencing
type: instructional_design
target_constraint: ["working_memory_overload", "instructional_confusion", "task_abandonment"]
complexity: medium
time_required: preparation_needed
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
Auditory/Visual working memory is limited. DHH students must "hold" the language to process it. Long streams of instruction cause the "buffer" to overflow. We must slice instructions into discrete, numbered visual packets.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Display)**
    * **Visual Numbering:** Teacher writes instructions as **1., 2., 3.** on the board (vertical list).
    * **Visual Dividers:** Teacher places a physical line or "Pause" icon between complex concepts on the slide.
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do - The Check)**
    * **The Chunk Check:** After explaining Step 1, teacher asks: *"Sign/Draw back to me what you do first."*
    * Teacher waits for confirmation before revealing Step 2.
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * Student uses a sticky note or card to physically cover Step 2 and 3, focusing only on Step 1 until it is done.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Instructions are visible for the *entire duration* of the task.
    * Teacher pauses distinctively between steps.
    * "Visual Dividers" (colors/lines) separate distinct ideas.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * **The "Wall of Text":** Paragraphs of text on a slide (impossible to process quickly).
    * Giving 3 instructions verbally in one breath.
    * Erasing the instructions once the class starts working.

## Strategy Node: Learning Intention Anchors

<metadata>
id: dom_c_anchors
name: Visual Learning Intentions & Icons
type: environmental_setup
target_constraint: ["lack_of_purpose", "vocabulary_confusion", "disengagement"]
complexity: low
time_required: setup_only
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
To lower anxiety and increase focus, the student needs a static "North Star." Visual icons map abstract goals (e.g., "Analyze") to concrete images, reducing the linguistic load of understanding *what* we are doing.

### Implementation Spec (System -> Routine -> Autonomy)
* **Phase 1: Teacher Habit (System)**
    * **Visual Objective Board:** A dedicated, colour-coded board area (Green=Goal, Blue=Success Criteria).
    * **Concept Icons:** Always pair high-use verbs with an image (e.g., 

[Image of a magnifying glass]
 next to the word "Analyse").
* **Phase 2: Class Norm (Routine)**
    * **Interactive Review:** At the start, a student physically moves a magnet/arrow to the current lesson phase on the agenda.
    * **Visible Agenda:** The lesson flow is drawn as boxes; boxes are ticked off as completed.
* **Phase 3: Student Autonomy**
    * Student refers to the board when lost, rather than asking "What are we doing?"

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * The Goal is static (written/printed), not just spoken at the start.
    * Icons are used consistently across subjects (e.g., same icon for "Write" in Science and English).
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * "Hidden Agenda": The goal is in the teacher's head or a closed PowerPoint.
    * Changing the icons/colours frequently (creates confusion).

## Strategy Node: Proximity & Non-Verbal Support

<metadata>
id: dom_c_proximity
name: Walk Around, Talk Around (Discreet Support)
type: pedagogical_routine
target_constraint: ["social_stigma", "fear_of_asking", "masked_confusion"]
complexity: medium
time_required: continuous_habit
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
Shouting corrections across the room embarrasses the student and is often inaudible. Support must be local (proximity-based) and visual (written), preserving the student's dignity and access.

### Implementation Spec (System -> Routine -> Autonomy)
* **Phase 1: Teacher Habit (System)**
    * **Written Re-instruction:** Teacher carries a small notepad or whiteboard. Corrections are *written down* (e.g., "Page 5, Q3") rather than shouted.
    * **Proximity Check-in:** Teacher loops the room and stands near the DHH student *before* they raise their hand.
* **Phase 2: Interaction Routine (Routine)**
    * **The "3-Second Pause":** When arriving at the desk, teacher waits 3 seconds for the student to look up before signing/speaking.
    * **Non-Verbal Scanning:** Teacher scans for "The Brow Furrow" or "The Freeze" (signs of confusion) and intervenes quietly.
* **Phase 3: Student Autonomy**
    * Student taps the notepad/whiteboard to request a written clarification instead of a spoken one.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Teacher crouches to eye level when helping.
    * Corrections are private and visual.
    * Teacher anticipates the need (arrives before the hand goes up).
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * **The "Shout Out":** Correcting the student from the front of the room.
    * **The "Hover":** Standing behind the student and talking to the back of their head.
