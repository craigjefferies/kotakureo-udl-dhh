# Domain F: Symbolic & Mathematical Structure (Concrete ↔ Abstract)

**Context:** These strategy nodes define the "Symbolic Translation Layer." They align with the *Numeracy* and *Science* curriculum, focusing on decoding abstract systems (Maths, Code, Formulas) that DHH students cannot "hear" or "overhear" naturally.

## Strategy Node: Visualizing Place Value (Structure)

<metadata>
id: dom_f_place_value
name: Place Value Structure & The "Teen/Ty" Trap
type: conceptual_scaffold
target_constraint: ["auditory_confusion_14_40", "abstract_symbol_blindness", "magnitude_error"]
complexity: medium
time_required: continuous_habit
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
DHH students often confuse "Teens" (14) and "Tys" (40) because they look similar on the lips and share high-frequency sounds. We must replace the *auditory* distinction with a *structural* one:
* **Teens** = $10 + \text{Unit}$ (Additive structure)
* **Tys** = $\text{Unit} \times 10$ (Multiplicative structure)

### Implementation Spec (Concrete -> Visual -> Abstract)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - Concrete)**
    * Teacher presents **Base-10 Blocks**.
    * Teacher explicitly contrasts the "Pile" (14 is a ten and 4 ones) vs. the "Stacks" (40 is 4 tens).
    * Teacher signs "10 plus 4" vs "4 groups of 10."
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do - Visual)**
    * **Place Value Houses:** Teacher draws the "Houses" (Hundreds, Tens, Ones) on the board.
    * Teacher asks: *"What happens if we multiply by 10?"*
    * Student physically moves the digit card one house to the left (Visualizing the shift), rather than just "adding a zero."
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do - Abstract)**
    * **Expanded Form Anchor:** Student writes numbers in expanded form ($345 \to 300 + 40 + 5$) underneath standard form equations to prove they see the magnitude, not just the digits.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Physical manipulatives are on the desk during abstract calculation.
    * Student writes the expanded form automatically when stuck.
    * Teacher uses the sign "Groups of" for multiplication.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * **"Just add a zero":** Teaching the trick without the concept (fails with decimals).
    * Relying on speaking "Fourteen" louder (Auditory strategy).

## Strategy Node: Decoding Math Vocabulary (The "Double Dictionary")

<metadata>
id: dom_f_math_vocab
name: Polysemous Words & Symbol Translation
type: literacy_intervention
target_constraint: ["lexical_ambiguity", "reading_comprehension_failure", "keyword_reliance"]
complexity: medium
time_required: preparation_needed
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
Math is a foreign language. Words like "Table," "Volume," and "Difference" have everyday meanings that confuse DHH students in a math context. Symbols ($\times$, $\div$) are often taught as names ("Times"), not actions ("Groups of").

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Wall)**
    * **The Math Dictionary Wall:** Teacher creates a "Double Meaning" section.
    * 

[Image of table furniture]
 (Crossed Out) vs 

[Image of data table]
 (Circled).
    * Teacher explicitly translates symbols to **Verbs**:
        * $\times$ $\to$ "Groups of"
        * $\div$ $\to$ "Shared between"
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do - Action Scripting)**
    * **Anti-Keyword:** Teacher bans "More means Plus."
    * **Action Scripting:** Teacher reads a word problem. Class draws the *movie* of the math. *"Are the piles coming together (Add) or are we comparing them (Subtract)?"*
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * Student highlights the "Action Verb" in the word problem before writing the equation.
    * Student signs the equation using the conceptual signs ("Groups of") rather than English signs ("Times").

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Word Wall explicitly contrasts the "Home" meaning vs "Math" meaning.
    * Students draw the action before writing the numbers.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * **Keyword Teaching:** Telling students "Left always means subtract" (Fails in "How many left handers are there?").
    * Using English-based signs (sign for TIME on a clock) for multiplication ($\times$).

## Strategy Node: Visualizing Operations (Bar Modeling)

<metadata>
id: dom_f_bar_modeling
name: Bar Modeling & Algorithm Checklists
type: problem_solving_strategy
target_constraint: ["word_problem_paralysis", "working_memory_overload", "sequencing_failure"]
complexity: high
time_required: full_lesson_structure
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
Word problems are 80% literacy, 20% math. DHH students get stuck on the syntax. Bar Modeling (Singapore Math)  strips away the words and visualizes the "Part-Part-Whole" relationship, bypassing the linguistic bottleneck.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Bar)**
    * Teacher reads the problem. *"Ignore the numbers first."*
    * Teacher draws the **Bar Model**: *"Is it two parts making a whole? Or a whole cutting off a part?"*
    * Teacher fills in the numbers only after the bar is drawn.
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do - The Checklist)**
    * **Algorithm Checklist:** For Long Division/Multiplication.
    * Teacher provides a vertical laminated list with icons (Divide $\to$ Multiply $\to$ Subtract $\to$ Bring Down).
    * Student moves a paperclip down the list as they solve each step.
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * **Visual Jumps:** On number line questions, student must **draw the jumps** (e.g., jumping to the nearest 10) to document their mental math strategy.
    * Student draws a Bar Model for every word problem before calculating.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Bar models appear in the margin of the workbook.
    * Checklists are physical (paperclips/magnets), reducing working memory load.
    * Emphasis on *setting up* the problem, not just the answer.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * "Just do it in your head." (Invisible process).
    * Rote memorization of algorithms without visual support.
    * Focusing only on the calculation speed.

## Strategy Node: Scientific & Digital Syntax (Formula Triangles)

<metadata>
id: dom_f_symbolic_syntax
name: Decoding Formulas & Code Syntax
type: structural_scaffold
target_constraint: ["abstract_formula_failure", "syntax_errors", "variable_confusion"]
complexity: high
time_required: 15_mins
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
In Science ($F=ma$) and Coding (`if x > 10`), symbols represent relationships. DHH students struggle to "read" the grammar of these equations. We must treat Formulas as **Sentences** that need to be parsed.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Triangle)**
    * **Formula Triangles:** Teacher presents $F=ma$ in a triangle format 

[Image of formula triangles physics]
.
    * Teacher demonstrates the "Cover Up" method: *"If I want 'a', I cover 'a', and I see $F \div m$."*
    * This turns algebraic manipulation into a visual operation.
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do - Variable Mapping)**
    * **Coding Syntax:** Teacher displays a line of code: `score = score + 1`.
    * Class uses colours to map the logic: *"Circle the Variable Blue. Circle the Value Red."*
    * Teacher asks: *"Where is the data going?"* (Visual flow).
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * **Parsons Problems:** Instead of writing code from scratch, students are given the correct lines of code (jumbled) and must **physically re-order** them to make the logic work.
    * Student draws the Formula Triangle at the top of the test paper immediately.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Formula triangles are drawn *before* attempting the question.
    * Students use colour to highlight variables in code/equations.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Telling students to "Just memorise the formula."
    * Assuming students understand that `$x$` and `$X$` are the same thing (or different).

## Strategy Node: Mathematical Discourse & Explanation

<metadata>
id: dom_f_math_discourse
name: Mathematical Discourse & Explanation
type: metacognitive_strategy
target_constraint: ["rote_calculation", "inability_to_explain", "passive_learning"]
complexity: high
time_required: continuous_routine
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
Current Domain F is strong on visual math tools but missing how DHH students EXPLAIN their mathematical thinking verbally/in writing. DHH students often learn "procedures" (rote steps) without understanding the "why." We must force the externalization of the internal logic to ensure true mastery.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Think-Aloud)**
    * Teacher solves a problem while explicitly speaking/signing their thinking process: *"First I looked at... Then I tried... I know this because..."*
    * **Sentence Stems:** Teacher points to a "Math Talk" poster with stems like *"I started by..."* and *"My evidence is..."*.
    * **Vocabulary Link:** Teacher explicitly links symbols to action words (e.g., $\div$ = "split into groups").
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do - The Interview)**
    * **Partner Protocol:** Pairs solve a problem. Partner A solves while Partner B holds a **"Tell Me More"** card.
    * Partner B prompts explanation at each step, preventing silent calculation.
    * **Error Analysis:** Class looks at a "Wrong Answer" together and explains *WHY* it is wrong, not just fixing it.
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do - The Journal)**
    * Student writes/signs a "Math Explanation" for one problem using the sentence stem menu:
        * *"I started by ___"*
        * *"Then I ___"*
        * *"This works because ___"*

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Sentence stems are visible and used during pair work.
    * Students explain *why* they did a step, not just *what* they did.
    * Error analysis is a regular part of the lesson.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Silent calculation without explanation.
    * Accepting the correct answer without asking for the method.
    * "Copying" the teacher's steps without understanding.
