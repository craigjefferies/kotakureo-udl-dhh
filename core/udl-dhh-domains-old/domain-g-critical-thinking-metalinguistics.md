# Domain G: Critical Thinking & Metalinguistics (Deep Dive)

**Context:** These strategy nodes define the "Metacognitive Layer." They focus on breaking the "Glass Ceiling" by explicitly teaching the internal cognitive processes (inference, perspective-taking, code-switching) that hearing students often pick up incidentally.

## Strategy Node: Explicit Code Switching (Register Mapping)

<metadata>
id: dom_g_code_switching
name: BICS vs. CALP (Register Mapping)
type: metalinguistic_strategy
target_constraint: ["informal_writing_style", "vocabulary_misuse", "tone_deafness", "social_academic_mix"]
complexity: medium
time_required: continuous_habit
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
DHH students often have one "mode" of communication. They do not intuitively grasp the shift between "Playground Chat" (BICS) and "Formal Academic Language" (CALP). We must visually map this distinction so they know *which* language tools to use.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Filter)**
    * **The "Academic Hat":** Teacher puts on a physical prop (hat/scarf) or flips a sign to "Formal Mode."
    * Teacher demonstrates translating a thought:
        * *Social:* "It got bigger."
        * *Academic:* "The organism expanded in volume."
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do - The Translator)**
    * **Register Board:** Teacher writes a "Social" sentence on the left side of the board.
    * Class works together to "translate" it to the "Academic" side using the Word Wall.
    * *Teacher Prompt:* "That is good Playground Sign, but how do we sign that for the Principal/Exam?"
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * Student highlights "Social" words in their draft (e.g., "big," "sad") and replaces them with "Academic" synonyms (e.g., "significant," "despondent") before submitting.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * The "Academic Mode" signal is visible during writing tasks.
    * Students explicitly ask: "Is this for friends or for the teacher?"
    * Teacher corrects tone ("Too casual") not just grammar.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Reading the text cold without context.
    * Showing the video *after* the lesson as a "reward" (missed scaffolding opportunity).

## Strategy Node: Reading Comprehension Strategies (Reciprocal Teaching)

<metadata>
id: dom_g_reciprocal_teaching
name: Reciprocal Teaching & Comprehension Monitoring
type: metacognitive_strategy
target_constraint: ["passive_reading", "comprehension_breakdown", "lack_of_monitoring"]
complexity: high
time_required: continuous_routine
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
DHH students often "bark at print" (decode without understanding). They need systematic tools to monitor their own comprehension. We externalize these internal processes using physical roles and visual cards.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Roles)**
    * Teacher introduces the **4 Strategy Cards** with visual icons:
        * **Predict (Crystal Ball):** *"I think the text will be about..."*
        * **Question (Question Mark):** *"I wonder why..."* (QAR: Right There vs. Think & Search).
        * **Clarify (Magnifying Glass):** *"I don't understand this word/idea..."*
        * **Summarize (Notepad):** *"The main point was..."*
    * Teacher reads a paragraph and explicitly "plays" one card: *"I am holding the Magnifying Glass. This word 'vast' is tricky. I think it means big."*
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do - The Circle)**
    * **Reciprocal Teaching Circle:** Small group reads a text.
    * Each student holds a physical card and is responsible for that job.
    * **Inference Equation:** Teacher displays the visual formula: **Text Clues + My Knowledge = Inference**.
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do - The Tracker)**
    * Student uses a **4-Column Note Template** (Predict | Question | Clarify | Summarize).
    * Student must fill in at least one entry per column while reading independently.
    * **Main Idea Sort:** Student physically sorts detail cards under "Main Idea Umbrellas" to prove structure.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Strategy cards are physical and on the table.
    * Students ask "Clarifying" questions (admitting confusion) without shame.
    * The "Inference Equation" is visible on the wall.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Teacher asks all the questions (Teacher-led vs. Reciprocal).
    * Students just read silently without stopping to process.
    * "Summaries" are just copying the first sentence.

## Strategy Node: Visual Morphology (The Anti-Phonics)

<metadata>
id: dom_g_morphology
name: Word Sums & Root Analysis
type: literacy_intervention
target_constraint: ["decoding_failure", "spelling_memorization", "vocabulary_bottleneck"]
complexity: medium
time_required: 15_mins
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
Phonics ("Sound it out") has diminishing returns for DHH learners with big words. Morphology (Meaning parts) is visual and logical. It turns vocabulary into "Lego building" rather than auditory memorization.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Matrix)**
    * Teacher draws a **Word Matrix** for a root (e.g., "Spect" = Look).
    * Teacher builds words: *In-spect* (Look in), *Spect-ator* (Person who looks).
    * Teacher proves the meaning connects to the root.
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do - Word Sums)**
    * **Math for Words:** Teacher writes: $Re + Construct + ion$.
    * Class signs the parts: "Again" + "Build" + "Noun". -> "Building it again."
    * Teacher asks: *"Why is there a 't' in Action but we say 'shun'?"* -> *"Because Act is the root!"* (Visual logic beats auditory rule).
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * When stuck on a long word, student covers the prefix/suffix to find the root *before* asking for help.
    * Student creates a visual equation: **Un- (Not) + Happy (Feeling) = Not Happy.**

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Word Sums ($Base + Suffix$) are visible on the board.
    * Teacher points to the *meaning* unit, not the sound unit.
    * "Sound it out" is banned for multi-syllable words.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Telling the student to "Sound it out" (Auditory blocked).
    * Teaching "Spelling Lists" without teaching the structural rules.

## Strategy Node: Metacognitive "Think-Alouds" (The Inner Voice)

<metadata>
id: dom_g_think_aloud
name: Modeling the Inner Voice
type: cognitive_modeling
target_constraint: ["impulsive_guessing", "lack_of_self_correction", "passive_reading"]
complexity: high
time_required: continuous_habit
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
Hearing children learn to think by listening to adults talk to themselves. DHH children miss this "auditory curtain." They see the *result* (the answer) but not the *struggle*. Teachers must perform the struggle visually to teach the process.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Struggle)**
    * Teacher reads a text and stops dramatically.
    * **The Narrative:** *"Wait. I am confused. Who is 'He'? Is it the Wolf or the Pig? I need to look back."*
    * Teacher points to the previous sentence. *"Ah, it says 'The Wolf ran'. So 'He' is the Wolf."*
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do - The Pause)**
    * Class reads together. Teacher signals a **"Thinking Pause."**
    * Teacher asks: *"What is your brain asking right now?"* (Not "What is the answer?").
    * Students pick a strategy card: [Re-Read], [Look at Picture], or [Ask a Friend].
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * **Annotation:** Student must write/draw one "?" symbol in the margin where they got stuck and explain *how* they solved it (e.g., "I looked at the glossary").

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Teacher validates "being stuck" as a smart learning moment.
    * Students narrate their problem-solving ("I didn't know the word, so I...") instead of just giving the answer.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Teacher reads the text smoothly without stopping (The "Perfect Expert" illusion).
    * Praising immediate answers (encourages guessing) rather than thoughtful ones.

## Strategy Node: Theory of Mind (ToM) Anchors

<metadata>
id: dom_g_theory_of_mind
name: Perspective Taking & Thought Bubbles
type: social_emotional_learning
target_constraint: ["reading_misinterpretation", "social_conflict", "literal_thinking"]
complexity: high
time_required: continuous_tool
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
DHH students are often delayed in Theory of Mind (understanding that others have different information). This devastates reading comprehension (e.g., knowing Little Red Riding Hood doesn't know the Wolf is in the bed). We must make "Thoughts" visible.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Bubble)**
    * Teacher holds a physical **Thought Bubble** prop over a character's head in a book/image.
    * Teacher asks: *"What does HE know? Does he know the trap is there?"*
    * Teacher contrasts it with the reader's view: *"WE know, but HE does not."*
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do - The Map)**
    * **Perspective Map:** Class draws two characters.
    * Teacher writes "The Secret" (e.g., The cake is gone) in Character A's bubble but *not* Character B's bubble.
    * Class discusses: *"How will Character B act? Surprised? Why?"*
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * Student draws a thought bubble on a post-it note and sticks it on the page to explain a character's motivation.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Thought Bubbles are standard classroom equipment.
    * Distinction between "Thinking" (Bubble) and "Speaking" (Speech Mark) is explicit.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Assuming the student understands the character's motivation.
    * Asking "Why did he do that?" without checking if the student knows what the character *knew*.

## Strategy Node: Visualization (Mental Imagery)

<metadata>
id: dom_g_visualization
name: Structure Words & Sketch-to-Stretch
type: comprehension_strategy
target_constraint: ["weak_recall", "low_detail_writing", "disconnected_ideas"]
complexity: medium
time_required: 20_mins
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
If you don't have the language to describe it, you often don't "see" it. We use specific "Structure Words" (Size, Color, Number, Shape, Where) to force the student to generate a high-resolution mental image, which improves memory and writing.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Modeling (I Do - The Description)**
    * Teacher looks at a hidden object.
    * Teacher uses the **12 Structure Words**: *"It is [Size], it is [Color], it is [Shape]..."*
    * Teacher draws what they see based *only* on those words.
* **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do - Sketch to Stretch)**
    * Teacher reads a sentence: *"The massive, green dragon sat on the tiny gold pile."*
    * Students must draw exactly that.
    * **The Check:** Teacher asks *"Where is your Gold? Is it tiny? Where is the Dragon?"* checking the resolution of the image.
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do)**
    * Before writing a story, student fills in a **Visual Planner** with the Structure Words to ensure they have a clear image to write from.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * Structure Word posters (Size, Color, Shape, etc.) are visible.
    * Student drawings are used as a "Draft" for writing.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Asking "Imagine a..." without giving the scaffolding words.
    * Accepting vague descriptions ("It was nice").

## Strategy Node: Experience First (Background Loading)

<metadata>
id: dom_g_experience_first
name: Background Loading & Realia
type: preparation_strategy
target_constraint: ["context_gap", "abstract_concept_failure", "vocabulary_disconnect"]
complexity: high
time_required: pre_lesson_activity
</metadata>

### Core Logic (The "Why")
You cannot read what you do not understand. Hearing kids pick up context from movies/news; DHH kids often don't. We must provide the "Hook" (Experience) *before* the text to ensure the schema exists.

### Implementation Spec (I Do -> We Do -> You Do)
* **Phase 1: Setup (I Do - The Hook)**
    * **Virtual Field Trip:** Teacher shows a 3-minute silent walkthrough video (e.g., of WWI trenches) *before* introducing the text.
    * **Realia Box:** Teacher brings in physical objects (e.g., a cone, a toga) for abstract units.
* **Phase 2: Guided Experience (We Do - The Enactment)**
    * **Sequence Re-enactment:** Class acts out the sequence of events physically or with puppets.
    * Teacher aligns the signs/labels with the physical movements.
* **Phase 3: Independent Application (You Do - The Link)**
    * Student refers back to the "Real Object" or "Video Memory" when answering questions about the abstract text.
    * Student uses the prop (e.g., the cone) to help solve the math problem.

### Evidence Guide (The Rubric)
* **Positive Signal (Success):**
    * The video/experience happens *before* the reading.
    * Physical objects are on desks, not just in a cupboard.
    * Students reference the experience ("Like the video!") in their writing.
* **Negative Signal (Failure Modes):**
    * Reading the text cold without context.
    * Showing the video *after* the lesson as a "reward" (missed scaffolding opportunity).
