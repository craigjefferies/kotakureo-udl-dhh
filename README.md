# Kotakureo UDL-DHH Framework

A practical framework for Universal Design for Learning (UDL) tailored for Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) students in New Zealand classrooms. This resource provides evidence-based strategies to support inclusive teaching and learning.

## What is UDL-DHH?

UDL-DHH integrates UDL principles with DHH-specific needs, emphasizing:
- **Bi-Literacy**: Bridging NZSL and English
- **Sensory Access**: Managing fatigue and physical environment
- **Multi-Modal Teaching**: Visual and auditory strategies
- **Student Agency**: Building independence and self-advocacy

## The 8 Domains

1. **Domain A: Bi-Literacy Bridge** - Visual grammar, shape coding, and language chaining
2. **Domain B: Sensory & Physical Access** - Fatigue management and visual attention cues
3. **Domain C: Multi-Modal Instruction** - Separation of modalities and information chunking
4. **Domain D: Explicit Teaching & Scaffolding** - Gradual release and error analysis
5. **Domain E: Mana Motuhake & Agency** - Self-advocacy and response systems
6. **Domain F: Symbolic & Mathematical Structure** - Visual models for math and science
7. **Domain G: Critical Thinking & Metalinguistics** - Code-switching and visualization
8. **Domain H: Whanaungatanga & Engagement** - Cultural identity and relationships

## How to Use This Framework

### For Teachers:
1. **Start Here**: Read `core/philosophy-engine.md` for foundational principles
2. **Choose a Domain**: Pick the area most relevant to your current challenge
3. **Apply Strategies**: Use the "Implementation Spec" for classroom-ready activities
4. **Monitor Success**: Check the "Evidence Guide" to track student progress

### Key Files:
- `core/udl-dhh-domains/` - Detailed strategy guides for each domain
- `core/udl-dhh-master-list.md` - Complete strategy inventory
- `artifacts/templates/` - Ready-to-use checklists and tools
- `tests/scenarios/` - Real classroom examples

## Why Use UDL-DHH?

- **Evidence-Based**: Strategies include clear implementation steps and success indicators
- **Culturally Responsive**: Grounded in Māori values and NZSL-English bilingualism
- **Practical**: Rated for time, complexity, and preparation needs
- **Holistic**: Addresses sensory, cognitive, and cultural aspects of learning

This framework helps create inclusive classrooms where DHH students can thrive academically and socially.
