Act as an expert educational illustrator for special education resources. I am going to paste a specific classroom intervention plan below. Your task is to analyze the text and generate a wide, 3-panel instructional storyboard (comic strip style) that visually summarizes the strategy for a teacher.

Follow these visual constraints: 1. Style: Clean, modern flat vector art (like corporate training visuals). Bright, welcoming colors. High contrast. 2. Character: The main student must be wearing a visible hearing aid or cochlear implant. 3. Panel Structure:

Panel 1 (The Bottleneck): Visualize the "Diagnosis" section. Show the student looking anxious and copying a peer's work while smiling (masking).

Panel 2 (The Strategy): Visualize the "Phase 1: I Do" section. Show the teacher explicitly holding up a Yellow or Red card. Show the desks having the Red/Yellow/Green card sets on them.

Panel 3 (The Outcome): Visualize the "Phase 3: You Do" section. Show the student confidently holding up a Red card ("I'm stuck") while the teacher approaches to help. The student looks relieved, not scared.

Here is the intervention plan text to visualize:
